PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY:

I am an accomplished network engineer with over one year of expertise in networking, infrastructure optimization, and network architecture. Leveraged strong foundation in software and hardware infrastructure. Implemented, maintained, and troubleshooted Juniper MX80 and MX104 routers to ensure optimal network performance and reliability. My work with Cisco Catalyst Switches involved deploying and managing these switches to enhance network performance and ensure seamless connectivity. Additionally, I have implemented Cisco Routers and switches in data center environments to provide high-density, scalable solutions for complex network infrastructures. Configured Cisco WLCs in an active-passive failover setup to ensure high availability for critical wireless networks. My responsibilities included configuring VLANs, managing trunk ports, and ensuring high availability through advanced features such as VPC. This hands-on experience enabled me to design, implement, and maintain robust network infrastructures that meet stringent performance and security standards. I configured security policies, managed firewall rules, and conducted regular audits to ensure compliance with security standards. Implemented advanced wireless security protocols, including WPA2/WPA3 encryption, 802.1X with EAP authentication, and MAC filtering to ensure network integrity. My expertise in routing protocol concepts, including TCP/IP, OSI, MPLS, EIGRP, LAN, and WAN has enabled me to establish cohesive hybrid infrastructures while meeting stringent security and compliance requirements, ultimately enhancing application availability and performance. Demonstrated exceptional written and oral communication skills in collaborating with cross-functional teams to design and implement network solutions. Applied strong analytical, problem-solving, ability to multi-task and attention to detail and troubleshooting skills to resolve complex network issues, ensuring uninterrupted operations.
