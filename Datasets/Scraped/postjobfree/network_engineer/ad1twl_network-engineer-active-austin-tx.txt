Pivot Networks, Austin, Texas
Senior Network Engineer/Director of IT (08/06 – 11/2017} As a senior member of the MSP, I provided on-site and remote support to Pivot’s diverse customer base, working mainly with larger, corporate clients as well as providing enterprise-level services to smaller businesses allowing them to leverage these tools to maximum advantage. A few highlights of my time there include:
• Provided Active Directory administration and management to Bank of America’s Military Bank Overseas Division, supporting thousands of users in a complex, multi-domain forest across the US, Europe and Asia. Designed and built the infrastructure, GPOs, DFS and other systems to create the teller and CSR user environments. Worked closely with MBOD staff in multiple countries to roll out these systems to every branch office in Europe and Asia. Guided the project to flatten the forest into a single domain. Continued to provide AD administration and support as needed.
• Served as highest escalation point for Active Directory, Exchange server and networking issues for all of Pivot’s clients.
