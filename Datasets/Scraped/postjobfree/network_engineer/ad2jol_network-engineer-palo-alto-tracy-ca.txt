Work Experience

Primacy SI – Network Architect
Working on Cloud, Security and Infrastructure Technologies (October 2021-Present)

Design and deployment of networking in Azure and AWS clouds for SDWAN using Aviatrix connecting remote sites to Multi-cloud setup. High level design:
oIPSEC tunnel from Aviatrix Transit Gateway to Silver peak
oThe MPLS provider which connects all remote sites had connection to AWS direct connect which was then connected to Transit gateway
oTransit gateway had multiple routing tables and hence route propagation had to be used for exchanging routes from routing table attached from direct connect to other routing tables
oRoutes from Transit gateway were then advertised to Aviatrix which was the transit for all traffic from cloud resources to site connectivity
Deployment of Express route with Virtual Hub and Azure premium firewall providing secure access to cloud services from onprem
Implemented multi VRF VXLAN on Cisco Nexus and Catalyst Switches with Border leaf connected to Palo Alto firewall providing security for both east-west and north-south traffic
Deployed Cisco SDA solution with Cisco Firewall as Fusion device, Catalyst 9500 as Core and 9300/9400 devices as part of SDA
Deployed Meraki MX firewalls with SDWAN and Umbrella integration to replace the existing MPLS circuits and provide enhanced security.
