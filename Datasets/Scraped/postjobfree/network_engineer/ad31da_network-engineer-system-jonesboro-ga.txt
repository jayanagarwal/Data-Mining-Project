Professional Experience
I am a veteran of the Vietnam War, I served in Thailand, in support of the war effort. My job was a communications analysis, from July 26, 1974- June 23, 1975, I was stationed at Udorn, Thailand. During that time I was expoxed to "Agent Orange". Saturday, April 16, 2011, I was rushed to the hospital, and was told that I would be a Diabetes the rest of my life. And I have to thanks the Veterans Administration, for All The Help given me. Over the years. I had problems, and the Va gave me and OK that I could go back to work, about October 2019. So I have been actively looking for work. And got a lot of "R T R", Rights to Represent, and got no feedback. So, I brought a Cisco lab, to work from home, and worked with Linkend Training, to keep up my skills and work on a project that I wanted to do, it is to pass the Cisco Collaboration, Implenting and Operating Cisco Collaboration Core Technologies, 350-801, CCIE version. So I have not been wasting time, but looking for work.
