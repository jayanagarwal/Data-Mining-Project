Deep Packet Inspection Project:
• Created a DPI which inspects in detail the data being sent over a computer network and accordingly will allow, block, reroute, or log data being sent.
• A virtual lab with two host machines, send data between the two devices while the DPI tool monitors the communication between each device.
Distance Vector Routing and Flow Control Simulator:
• A network topology is given by the user for path computations and routing using the distance vector algorithm with different configurations like path costs, number of flows and packages.
• Consists of two major parts Distance Vector Computation, Forwarding and Routing Algorithm.
• In Distance Vector Computation, the user enters the path costs, and the distance vectors are computed by the program, and exported to a text file. While in the other part: the program takes the output of first part as an input to construct the topology. The user enters each packet flow to be executed and then the program simulates the traffic. Socket Programming with C:
• A Simple TCP Client program that takes the hostname/IP of the server and port number of the Server as Command Line arguments and can send messages to that server and receive the response from the server back.
• A Simple TCP Single-Client Server program that takes the port number as command-line argument and can listen and accept a client connection and interact with the client till it says "Bye" just like a simple chat application.
• A Multi-client Echo Server using fork that sends the same response back to client that client sent.
• A raw socket implementation of ICMP echo ping programme that fills all the headers starting from Ethernet header to ICMP header with payload (Complete packet implementation from Scratch). Automatic Teller Machine:
• Mini Web Application with friendly interface.
