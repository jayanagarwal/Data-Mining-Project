Work Experience
Plant Manager/Operations Manager
McCall Farms-Effingham, SC
April 2008 to August 2011
I initially started at McCall Farms as a closer operator. I moved up to fill room supervisor and eventually 3rd shift plant manager. I am looking for a company that I can settle in with for the long haul. I have experience in receiving, production, shipping, safety, quality control, certifying employees for forklift driving, and I have operated forklifts most of my life. I am experience at analyzing situations and solving problems with ease. I am a dedicated employee that takes pride in not missing days at work, and I'm a firm believer in being on time. I believe in inspiring others to do better no matter what the situation, and I believe in safety, efficiency, and excelling, no matter what position I am hired for. I also do not mind starting at the bottom and proving myself for any position needed. I moved from Florence S.C. in 2011 to bury my father in Rowan County N.C. where he lived at the time and during my stay in Mooresville, I managed a Manufactured Stone Company by the name of Old Carolina Stone for two years. I got into commercial landscaping development upon coming back into S.C. for several years. I have owned and operated a Commercial Landscaping Company here in Florence South Carolina taking care of grounds maintenance for several multi-family complexes from 2015 until 2023. I am currently employed at the Yahnis Distribution Company in Florence S.C. and I work in receiving. Education
