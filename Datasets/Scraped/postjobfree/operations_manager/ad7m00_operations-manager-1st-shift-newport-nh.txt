I am about to turn 46 years old, Fun-loving, easy going, I learn quickly, and I enjoy expereincing new jobs, ideas, just about everything. I consider myself a jack of all trades. I am not affriad to do the dirty work. Knowledge is power, the more a person pushes themselves, the better they are in life. I’ve had a job since I was 15, from bagging grocerices to being a nurses aide. Not to mention I am a parent, so I experience something new on a daily basis.

Operations Manager
Big Mikes Cleaning & Maintenance LLC
Newport, N.H.
12/2022 - 10/2023
I assisted the owner with helping the business run smoothly with the daily operations on the 1st shift and on 3rd shift I did the dirty work of cleaning. Answering phones, scheduleing, inventory, greeting new clients, trainning new employees, ordering product, book work, payroll, obtaining new clients, hiring/firing process, cleaning, buffing, waxing, stripping of floors.
Management
Dunkin’ Donuts of New London, N.H.
09/2019 - 05/2020
As part of management my duties were counting cash, going to the bank, entering the daily cash amounts in the computer, making sure the books were balanced correctly, ordering stock, inventory, hiring/firing process, trainning new staff, and handled customer complaints. As a crew member I waited on customers, stocked, ran the cash register, made orders, cleaned the store, made sure everything was in clean and working order for the next day. I’ve worked in the Dunkin Brands for 20 years roughly for 5 different owners, so I have done just about everything there is/was to do in the company from bake the donuts(when they did) up to management.
