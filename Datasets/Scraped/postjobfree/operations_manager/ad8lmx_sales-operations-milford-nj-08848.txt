Business and Sales Operations Manager
After a brief pause from corporate sales operations while caring for my child born prematurely, I am eager to re-enter the dynamic realm of business operations management. During my hiatus, I was able to keep current with my skills in sales as a licensed Realtor. This period of time reinforced my ability to prioritize, problem-solve, and maintain composure under pressure, skills essential to both caregiving and operational leadership. With 15 years of experience optimizing processes, streamlining workflows, and fostering team collaboration, I am poised to make an impactful return. By earning certifications in VSP Business Continuity (BC) and Desktop Virtualization (DV), I have proven that I can efficiently manage large volumes of data in virtualized environments, become an expert on complex technical platforms, and pass on my knowledge to the larger team. With a proven track record of driving efficiency and sales growth, I am positioned as a valuable asset to any organization. I am ready to bring my strategic mindset, adaptability, sales acumen, coolness under pressure, and unwavering commitment to excellence back to the corporate workplace, contributing to the success and growth of your team.
