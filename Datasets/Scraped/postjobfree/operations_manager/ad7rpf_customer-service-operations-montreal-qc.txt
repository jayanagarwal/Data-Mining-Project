I am an experienced team leader in a hands on customer facing role with a strong background in customer service, project management, and logistics. I am known for my personal effectiveness and flexibility and an above average ability to adapt operational activity to meet a changing environment. Having led a variety of teams including a working group of intellectually disabled persons for a non for profit organization, I have a proven track record in inspiring, motivating and encouraging diverse people to meet or exceed objectives. I believe that effective leadership is defined as much by character as it is by core competencies. I am a committed, hardworking and loyal team player that believes in leading by example. I am guided in my actions and decisions by organizational principles that promote the wellbeing of my employer and that of those for whom I am responsible. My experience spans several industries including nonprofit, merchandising, call center and customer service management, commercial construction products, warehouse management and distribution.
