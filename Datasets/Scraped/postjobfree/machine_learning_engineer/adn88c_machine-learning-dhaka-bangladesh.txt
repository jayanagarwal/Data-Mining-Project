This machine learning model predicts the status of chronic kidney disease based on various factor. Extensive data visualization and data preprocessing were done on the real-world data. The model were hyper-parameter tuned and cross validated to get the best result. Projects
PREDICT THE SENTIMENTS OF AMAZON CUSTOMER
This is a machine learning based project that predicts the sentiments of Amazon's customer using classification algorithm. NLP model and resampling methods were used on the real- world data set to build a better model.
PREDICT THE STOCK NEWS HEADLINES
This is an NLP model that predicts the future stock prices which was trained on real-world data. The model were hyperparameter tuned using grid search and cross validation were also performed.
PREDICT THE HOTEL BOOKING CANCELLATION
This machine learning project uses multiple algorithm to predict hotel booking cancellation based on real-world data. Detailed data analysis and data cleaning process is performed here.
SENTIMENT ANALYSIS WITH THREE PRE-TRAINED LANGUAGE MODEL (BERT, ELMO, ULM-FIT)
