Harrisburg University Center for Innovation & Entrepreneurship Harrisburg, PA Machine Learning Engineer Intern 07/2023 - Present AI teaching assistant chatbot development and deployment
Designed and deployed a chatbot in the metaverse environment serving as an AI teaching assistant for elementary school students, employing the technique of retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
Orchestrated the development of a robust ETL pipeline, implementing periodically automated triggers for the Word2Vec embedding model, and seamlessly converted documents of teaching material into vectors.
Optimized the performance of the Llama-2 model within the specific domain of elementary school education through Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT), addressing challenges related to limited data.
Implemented an intent recognition model with BERT Embeddings for accurate user prompt classification, and seamlessly integrated a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model into the chatbot, fostering a more immersive user experience in the metaverse.
Applied MLOps expertise to the pipeline for CI/CD, integrated Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor for performance monitoring, and executed Canary deployment for testing the new chatbot. National Sun Yat-Sen University Kaohsiung, R.O.C (Taiwan) Data Analyst Intern 03/2020 - 12/2021
