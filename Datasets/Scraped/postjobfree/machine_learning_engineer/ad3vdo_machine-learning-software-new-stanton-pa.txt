EDUCATION
Georgia Institue of Technology, Atlanta, GA Dec 2024 Master of Science in Computer Science (Machine Learning) Relevant Coursework: Machine Learning, AI for Robotics, Computer Vision, Video Game Design/AI, NLP University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA May 2021
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. GPA: 3.52/4.0 EXPERIENCE
Software Engineer Intern, Edge AI Solutions, Pittsburgh, PA Fall 2022
• Research integration possibilities of machine learning into the production of pipeline reports
• Applied Python to develop and test integrations, gaining knowledge of robot use in pipelines and PACP reports
• Created a JavaScript program to parse Json file information to subtitle video received from robot inspection, which was integrated into the company website and larger program Test Engineer, Yamaha Fall 2022
• Updated newly pushed software onto a virtual simulation and ran tests to document performance of automated vehicle in a simulated environment
• Conducted simulations with physical hardware to check performance and identify any issues when hardware was introduced
• Uploaded software to automated vehicle and tested in real-world environments
• Compiled test results and reported any bugs or issues PROJECTS
Object Tracking and Pedestrian Detection
• Developed a tracking and detection system using Kalman and Particle filters
• Preprocessed images to assist in detection using the filter methods to find center of an object
• Then developed the algorithm to further track motion and be robust through occlusion of object Motion Detection
• Computed a flow field to understand the observation of particle movement as flow vectors
• Implemented a Hierarchical Lucas-Kanade algorithm to detect motion through dense flow fields
• Further used this algorithm and my method to roughly classify motion between running/walking Particle Filter
• Developed a particle filter in Python to accurately locate an orbiting satellite and/or planet
• Used gravitational measurements taken at each timestep to approximate the location of the satellite
• Used weighted filtering and weighted average to guess the location, and sent a signal to the satellite for recovery
SLAM Drone
• Developed a simultaneous localization and mapping drone in Python
• Mapped current and previous obstacles while maneuvering through its environment towards the goal
• Created a planner to return from the goal to the starting destination using its knowledge of mapped obstacles
SKILLS
Programming Languages: Python, C#, Java, SQL, React Tools: Git/GitHub, Jira, Pandas, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, Unity
