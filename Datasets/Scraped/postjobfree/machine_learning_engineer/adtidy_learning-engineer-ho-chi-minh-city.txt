PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
6/2022 – 10/2022 Company:Greystone Data Systems
Projects: Camera de-kit
Position: Machine learning Engineer
Responsibility:
- Research model segmentation to recognize and crop image and damaged position detection
- Create Data box and bag for model.
- Processing, Analysis data for model yolov5 and ResUnetPlusPlus
- Recognize box and bag:
+ Pipeline: Image ->Yolov5-> Resnet50 -> Output.
- Crop box and bag:
+ Pipeline: Image -> Yolov5 -> ResUnetPlusPlus -> OpenCV to crop and rotation image.
- Damaged position detection:
+ Pipeline crop box -> Yolov5.
- Train, Test, Improve model.
- Build Dockerfile environment to integrate model into software. Projects: Detect and Action recognition: (Research + Test) Position: Artificial Intelligence
Engineer Responsibility:
- Research patterns to Detect and compare models: Yolov5, Yolov4, SSD, Mask RCNN
- Research patterns to Track and compare models: Strongsort, Deepsort
- Build model Classification.: Transfer learning resnet50+GRU
- Choosing the right technology for Xavier NX of Nvidia
- Collect 5 category data for yolov5 and 2 class for Classification from source RTSP.
- Processing, Analysis, Selection of Data and Label for model yolov5. Analysis 2 class of model Classification, process data into 5D form for input (B, T, H, W, C) and output are 1 and 0 for 2 class
+ Pipeline Source RTSP -> Yolov5-> Strongsort with Osnet -> Classification -> Output
- Use yolov5 to detect, strongsort to Tracking and Classification to action recognition
- Deploy project on Xavier NX with SDK Deepstream of nvidia
+ Pipeline on Deepstream: 2 Source -> Stream Mux ->Primary Detector (yolov5.engine)-> Object Tracker (Deepsort + Reid) -> Secondary classifies (Classification) -> OSD -> Sink Techniques:
- Deep Learning, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Linux, Github and Deepstream 6/2021 – 4/2021 Company: Gtopia (6 months internship) Projects: Smoke and Fire detection
Position: Machine Learning Engineer Responsibility:
- Collect data from source: youtube google…
- Data processing, analysis and evaluation
- Analyze and evaluate model, improve model in accuracy and FPS.
- Researching and building models for yolov5 to detect. Resnet50 for classification Techniques:
- Deep Learning (Object detection, Classification), Pytorch, Tensorflow, Linux and Github. AWS HONOURS AND AWARDS
4/2018 Programming competition in University of Education HCMC 2018 (UP - OLP)
- My team was placed 2nd among 25 teams.
