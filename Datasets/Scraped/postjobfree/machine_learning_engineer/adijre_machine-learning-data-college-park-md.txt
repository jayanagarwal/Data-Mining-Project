Human Obstacle Detector Nov 2020
• Developed a C++ based software for real time object and tracking using monocular camera.
• Agile Iterative Process (AIP) guidelines and Test-Driven Development (TDD) process were used to develop the module.
• Ensured the quality of the software by writing unit tests using continuous integration. Dog Breed Classifier July 2020
• Built a CNN model in TensorFlow and used it to predict the breed of a dog. Refined the model using transfer learning.
• Used Resnet101 architecture for transfer learning which increased the accuracy from 72% to 91%. Path Planning for a Turtle-bot May 2020
• Implemented Dijkstra, A* and RRT* algorithm for finding path between start and goal point while avoiding obstacles.
• A custom shape map was build using python and the final output was shown in a GUI drawn using OpenCV in Python. Visual Odometry April 2020
• Calculated Fundamental and Essential matrix using 8-point algorithm and improved the results by integrating RANSAC and Zhang’s estimation method.
• Calculated camera pose using linear triangulation while checking for chirality condition. Advanced Lane Line Detection using Python and OpenCV March 2020
• Used concepts of color segmentation, homographic transformations and sliding window algorithm to develop a code that can detect lane lines from the noisy image frames in 98% of the frames. AR Tag detection Feb 2020
• Detected the corner and orientation of the tag using OpenCV.
• Calculated the homography and projection matrix and used them to superimpose an image and cube on the tag. Controls of Two Pendulum Cart Setup Nov-Dec 2019
• Developed an LQR and LQG controller for the two-pendulum cart setup and simulated the results using MATLAB. Maze Solving Robot Nov-Dec 2019
• Developed a C++ program to drive a robot inside the maze from the start position to goal position.
• Breadth-First Search algorithm was used to compute the path and navigate the robot inside the maze. PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION
Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree July 2020
• Deployed Sentiment Analysis model, Payment Fraud detection, Plagiarism Detector model using AWS Sagemaker.
• Developed and deployed a predictive analysis model to determine whether a person is probable customer or not based on the demographic data given by Arvato Financial Services.
• Used XGBoost, AdaBoost, Linear and Logistic Regression, K Means and other Machine Learning algorithms in the process.
