2, Removing background with Chroma Key Technique
- Description: Input: image or video and background Output: Image or video which has been replaced background 5, Speech Emotion Recognition for Vietnamese
- Description : Input : Audio or Record for 5-10
seconds
Output: Emotion
- Method : + Collect 500 Vietnamese audio and
combine with IEMOCAP and RAVDESS dataset
+ Build model using two methods:
traditional Machine Learning with hand-crafted
features ( pitch, harmonic,…) and Deep Learning
+ Conduct three experiments for
each method:
- Use only Vietnamese dataset
- Use English dataset to train
then test on Vietnamses dataset
- Combine two languages
+ Evaluate two methods and choose
the best one
- Team size: 5
- Finishing time: 1 months
- Role: Build Deep Learning model and conduct
three experiments
- Tech used : Python, Flask
- Github:

Emotion-Recognition-for-Vietnameses
PROJECTS
- Method: + Convert image or frame (video) from RGB to HSV color space
+ Detach H and S color space and use K-means Clustering algorithm to cluster background pixel value in these color spaces
+ Calculate Gauss distribution of background
+ Create image mask with Gauss distribution
+ Remove background with formula: mask * image +
background * (1- mask)

4, Social Distancing Violation Detection
- Description : Input: image or video
Output: image or video with red bouding boxes if it has violation
- Method: + Pick 4 points to define detection area ( ROI )
+ Use pretrained Yolov4 to detect person and choose bottom
– center point in each bouding box to represent that box coordinate
+ Convert ROI to top-down view with perspective transform
+ Calculate scale beetween pixel and real distance
+ Calculate pixel distance beetween each pair of bouding boxes and using scale to convert it to real distance
+ Drawn red boxes for pairs that have distance under 2m
