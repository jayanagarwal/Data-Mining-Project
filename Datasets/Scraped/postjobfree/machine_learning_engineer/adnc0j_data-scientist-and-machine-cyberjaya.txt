PROJECTS
Financial transactions fraud detection
It is both a research and a development project, which achieved new significant results in fraud detection taking in consideration all the 26 papers published on this topic.
It tests many models on different datasets, and deals with complex data problems and solve them using advanced sampling techniques.
Provides a genuine new idea of 2 layers model, each layer with 2 models, using deep learning and auto-encoders
Achieved significant accuracy of 99.4%
Search Engine optimized text generator using GPT-2
The goal of this project is to generate paragraphs or articles that are search engine optimized, so when these paragraphs are included in web page, it will achieve high rank
The idea is genuine, market analysis and planning was done
The project provides real time fine-tuning and real time inferences
It uses many advanced technologies, libraries and frameworks, where I have used Docker, GPT-2 API, Tensorflow, Bitbucket, CUDA, SAM and Sagemaker on AWS cloud.
I made the project fully compatible with the latest instants of GPUs provided on the cloud
I developed the project fully, in terms of providing all its functionalities, which includes: text crawling, preprocessing, automated training, automated deployment, text generation, S3 file storing, and returning back a cleaned results.
The project was developed with high abstraction, where changes and improvements can be done later without effecting other parts of the project
Covid-19 Analysis
One of the biggest personal projects that I published online as an open source, the project follows the full standard data science/ machine learning cycle.
It used 7 different big datasets to answer crucial questions about COVID-19
Many graphs and charts were built through this project
It was built using R language only
The project contains 73 pages done during one month
For the advanced analysis, the project uses machine learning models to come up with relationships between features and output, which is the stage of inferences
The project includes medical model and required some medical domain knowledge to build SIR model, which in our case became an SIS model, which is the stage of prediction Clustering Malaysian universities by market needs
The project uses python on IBM Watson cloud
No ready dataset was found, so I built my own crawler to collect data about Malaysian universities and clean them
The data was used to cluster the universities according to the services around them, using FourSquare API and show the clustering on a live map.
