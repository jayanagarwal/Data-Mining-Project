An enthusiastic Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for learning new technologies. My skills are more engineer-oriented. My strongest programming language is Python, which I’ve used for almost tasks from crawling and processing data to machine learning and web development and operation. Besides it, I like to work with data because each data have its own insight and value, I like to discover them and bring them into the application. I also like to research Machine Learning and Deep Learning, especially generative models. In addition, I have also worked with MLOps in GCP. EXPERIENCES

Owner / Federated Learning for Credit Scoring 2022 Graduate Thesis
• Implement Federated Learning on the Home Credit Default Risk dataset to show that we can collaboratively train a deep learning model without data leakage.
• The Home Credit Default Risk dataset was published in a Kaggle competition to predict which loan applicants are unable to repay their loans. I performed exploratory data analysis and split the data into 50 nodes to simulate 50 contributors. I then used the Federated Averaging and Federated Proximal algorithms to train a shared machine learning model to detect which customers are unable to repay their loans.
• The result shows that the accuracy of the centralized and decentralized models is not so different. Tech stack: Pytorch
Owner / Comment classification 2021
Personal Project
• Extract over 100,000 comments from Shopee’s e-commerce website using a web crawler, then processed the data and created a dictionary by tokenizing all of the comments.
• Classify comments by using Logistic Regression with high accuracy.
• Create a website with a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the model and push the web app to the docker hub.
Tech stack: Underthesea, Django, docker
