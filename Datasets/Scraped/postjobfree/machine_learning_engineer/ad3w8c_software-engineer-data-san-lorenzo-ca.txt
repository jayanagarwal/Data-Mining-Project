Math Tutor
I have tutored high school student math, who’s math grade make sufficient improvement after my tutoring. (from C- to B+).
Salesperson
I worded as salesman in T-Mobile (sale network and phone call service to customers). Since I joined the sales team, I had helped my team increase the sales amount by 20%, and because of that, my team become top sales team in the area, me personally gained the title of top sale when I just join. My succeed in this field not only because of my excellent communicate skill, but my logical thinking, I can always analyze the customer’s right demand after talking with them, which I believe can help my problem-solving skill in my passion field software engineer.
Casino corporation:
I also worked in casino, and my task is keep watching the game and make sure the game running correctly. For example, making sure card dealer pay out correctly, and the house way that dealer set correctly. Especially, the game called “Double hand”, it includes seven cards in one hand, dealer usually set the hand fast, so it requires you take glance of the hands and recognize what kind of hand immediately. This job needs me to highly pay attention on the game. This working experience trains me to be highly sensitive to something incorrect such as BUGs when I am coding.
