Employment
National Science Library June 2012 – Aug. 2014
Data Analyst Beijing, China
• Academic literature and patent data mining and statistic analysis.
• Generated reports on the latest subject trends and global research hot-spots.
• Developed training courses for researchers on data acquisition, management, and analysis tools.

Key Projects Aug. 2019 – Present
Biomedical Image Denoising
• Cooperated with Prof. Georgakoudi’s optical diagnostics research lab to denoise diseased tissue images by exploiting deep learning techniques.
• Utilized both ground truth and Noise2Noise image denoising methods to train multiple denoising models based on a residual U-net architecture.
• Worked closely with biomedical researchers to continuously optimize models by evaluating the denoised images. Query System Towards COVID-19 Researches
• Employed the Nature Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques (ELMo, k-nearest neighbors) to develop a query system to retrieve related academic articles from the COVID–19 Open Research Data Set.
• Embedded BERT Summarizer in the query system to summarize the retrieved articles. Comparison of Various Classification Methods for Sentiment Reviews
• Explored the impact of different preprocessing methods on sentiment classification results.
• Built three models (logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and random forest) with well-tuned hyper-parameters to do sentiment classification and analyzed the results. Exploring Different Action-value Methods’ Performance for Non-stationary Problem
• Combined the incremental sample average method with three different action selection methods (greedy method, ϵ-greedy method, and greedy optimal initial method) to solve the non-stationary 10-arm testbed problem.
• Switched to the exponential recency-weighted average method to combine with the same action selection methods used in the first part to solving the same non-stationary 10-arm testbed problem.
• Analyzed and compared the above two action-value methods’ performance.
