Research Assistant Jul 2023 - Aug 2023
Project: Emerging Properties of Recently Developed Deep Learning Models Advisor: Prof. Khoa Doan
• Conducted literature review on the alternative learning algorithms to backpropagation.
• Implemented the forward-forward algorithm with 2 diﬀerent training procedures and 2 diﬀerent ways of choos- ing the negative data, analyzed the strange behavior of the model and presented the result to the team. College of Engineering and Computer Science @ VinUniversity Hanoi Research Assistant Mar 2022 - Jul 2022
Project: Robust Optimization for Electric Vehicles Smart Charging Advisor: Prof. Laurent El Ghaoui
• Designed experiments and implemented algorithms in Matlab to compare the performance of diﬀerent modelling strategies to the EV charging problem, including the robust optimization methods.
• Shown that the robust algorithms are more ﬂexible with uncertainties in the electricity availability, and more eﬃcient in terms of total charging cost under uncertainties in the electricity price.
• Conducted literature review, visualized experimental results, and suggested improvements to the modelling method.
Projects
Transformer-based Reinforcement Learning Pytorch, OpenAI GYM May 2023 - Present
• Implemented the Decision Transformer model and evaluated its performance in the GYM Atari environment.
• Tested the generalizability of the model to multiple environments by training the model simultaneously in 4 games, achieved an intelligent agent that can get high score in both environments. Face Veriﬁcation C++, OpenCV May 2023
• Utilized OpenCV and machine learning techniques to build an app to detect the face using camera, show the corresponding identity stored in the database, and create a list of people showing up. Image Generation with Dall-E React, Express, MongoDB, OpenAI API Mar 2023
• Developed a full-stack web app that takes user’s prompts, generates images from these prompts using the Dall- E API, and allows users to share them publicly with the community. Leadership
TinFam Team Leader Jun 2022 - Oct 2022
• Developed a website that helps farm owners of smart farms to raise capital from their customers.
• Managed a team of 7 people to develop the product, contact potential customers, and participate in the TechY- outh Incubator 2022.
