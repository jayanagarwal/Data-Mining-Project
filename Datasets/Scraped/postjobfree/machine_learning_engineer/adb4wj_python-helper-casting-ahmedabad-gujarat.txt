PILOT TECHNOCAST January 2020 – February 2020
Casting Manufacturer pioneering organization with the latest technical know-how and vast experience in SHELL MOULDED SAND CASTING PROCESSES.
Machine Learning Engineer
Provide Trained Model for Classification between defective and non-defective Casting Product from Images with Convolution Neural Network and Image Processing.
• Preprocessing and Data Augmentation: Preprocess given Images by resizing it, removing noise from Images and Apply Morphology (Smoothing) on Images. Also applied necessary Image Augmentation to not overfit in the future.
• Trained AlexNet from scratch: Trained AlexNet Model on training and testing generators with different parameter tunings to get more than 95% accuracy.
• Fine-Tuned VGG16: Trained VGG16 by fine-tuning ImageNet weights on a given set with hyperparameter tunings to get 98% accuracy with no overfitting.
