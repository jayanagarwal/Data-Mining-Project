RESEARCH PROJECTS

An EEG Artifact Identification Embedded Hardware using ICA and Multi-Instance Learning
A novel software-hardware system that uses a weak supervisory signal to indicate that some noise is occurring.
The EEG data is decomposed into independent components using ICA, and these components form bags that are labeled and classified by a multi- instance learning algorithm
Technology: Python 3 using numpy and scikit-learn packages, C++, CUDA for parallel implementation, R, Matlab, Machine Learning (Independent Component Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Multi-Instance learning, SVM)
Raspberry pi Hadoop Cluster based Data processing
Created a Raspberry Pi based cluster used for Data Analysis
The map-reduce tasks are scheduled and executed in parallel, thereby increasing the speed, efficiency of the entire system.
Performance of cluster (3 nodes) is tested
Low Power Embedded Processor Exploration for Multi-Physiological Stress Monitoring
A multi-physiological stress detection system containing data acquisition by sensors, feature extraction, and machine learning classifier
The entire stress detection system which consists of feature extraction and KNN classifier is implemented on various platforms including Artix-7 FPGA, NVIDIA TK1 ARM-A15 CPU and Kepler GPU and NVIDIA TX2 ARM - A57 CPU including the Maxwell and Pascal GPU

Technology: C, CUDA, MPI (multi-threaded program which runs on multiple cores),piCUDA, Matlab, Machine Learning (SVM, KNN).

Aswini Integrated Technologies, Hyderabad, India
Software Developer Sept 2014 – July 2015

Test the quality of the Product sample and track the sample status sent to the lab for testing.
Created Users for Login, assigning roles and provided authorizations to the users.
Developed interactive user interfaces using JavaScript, Twitter Bootstrap, JQuery, PHP, HTML5 and CSS.
Designed a dynamic user interface of the web application using ASP.NET
SQL Server is used as a data base and deployed the web application in Apache tomcat.
Technology: HTML, CSS, Twitter Bootstrap, JQuery, PHP, ASP.NET and SQL.
ACADEMIC PROJECTS

A Framework for Scene Recognition Using CNN as Feature Extractor and Machine Learning Kernels as Classifier
A framework was implemented in MPI for scene recognition by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a feature extractor and using SVM and Perceptron for Classification.
Images with large dimensions were converted into features with small dimensions and the output of the CNN was provided as input to different ML Kernels. Comparison of Serial and Parallel implementation of the frame work was performed for training and classification of various images on Bluewave cluster.
Game of New Eleusis
Card game designed using Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning Techniques.
Designed an Agent who plays the game and predicts the rule decided by the dealer based on the combinations thrown on the table
