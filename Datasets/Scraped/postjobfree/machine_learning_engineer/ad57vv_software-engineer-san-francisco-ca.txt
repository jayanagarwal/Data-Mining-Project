EXPERIENCE
Software Engineer- Smith Kettlewell Eye Research Institute June 2023 - present Sound classification model:
• Architected a ML model with cross functional team that utilizes a transformer model mimicking human brain to differentiate real and computer-generated sounds leveraging python and deep learning techniques.
• Identified inefficiency and improved the model accuracy with on device algorithm development to more than 92% with an average precision of 85% using TensorFlow and python normalization techniques.
• Designed and implemented auto testing suits and utilized object-oriented programming to increase productivity and improve performance metrics with CUDA for data loading and processing. Head tracking for target acquisition:
• Spearheaded a head tracking project using computer vision techniques like PyTorch in python for blind echolocators and achieved 92% frame extraction accuracy while incorporating CI/CD pipeline.
• Proposed and executed plan to append binaural sound capturing to trap echoes which improved the sound signal analysis by 40%.
• Identified noise signals from the result of data pipeline and corrected them after testing to improve accuracy with less than 10% interpolated data for final extraction.
Software Development Engineer - Nu Eta Technologies January 2020 - January 2021
• Participated with cross-functional team of a video content management system, utilizing Node.js and AWS for efficient storage and adaptive encoding resulting in 20% less retrieval time.
• Incorporated REST API and other web services with Jira agile methodology for task management to leverage a highly scalable content delivery network resulting in 35% reduction in buffering and load time.
• Teamed up with UI/UX designers to enhance the user interface, resulting in a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, contributing to a 15% increase in user engagement. Software Engineering intern - Royal Solusoft LLP October 2018 - April 2019
• Collaborated with a team of 5 to develop a finance management software based on Java microservice architecture and SQL for operational efficiency and scalability.
• Integrated API driven one click tax filing file generator with cloud based market expanding capabilities and securing 90% code coverage with JUnit testing framework.
• Orchestrated the migration from a monolithic to a Java microservices architecture, improving system modularity and scalability, and reducing deployment times by 30%.
PROJECTS
Predictive modeling of wildfire: May 2023
• Leveraged machine learning models to predict potential wildfires based on 1.86 million past US wildfire dataset.
• Built a user interactive interface using D3.js to analyze the trained wildfire model on a map with capabilities of feature manipulation.
• Visualized data input from MongoDB with MapReduce and managed predicted output using TensorFlow and PyTorch for clear understanding of how historical data differs from the predicted wildfires data. AI ChatBot: January 2023
• Finetuned a model based on OpenAI’s Davinci model with natural language processing with 1000s of sample questions generated from user study performed on undergraduate students from diverse group.
• Developed a web application using React and JavaScript for university students seeking help with course selection and necessary prerequisites for the classes with 70% reliable responses. Gator Learn: November 2021
• Designed a tutoring website infrastructure for university students to get in touch with tutors from 77+ different academic areas for online coursework help.
• Lead a backend team by working along with 4 members while maintaining database and streamlined connection with AWS, RDS service for setting up a proper multi-tiered system.
• Co-ordinated with cross functional team and populated table with 100’s of testing and training rows for easy addition and retrieval and uninterrupted user interface.
