For 10+ years, I’ve been programming professionally in the field of Computer Vision Engineering. I have good experience in designing, training, and evaluating varied deep neural networks such as a deep network for License Plate Detection and Recognition, Low-Quality OCR, Lung Cancer Detection, Logo Recognition, Face Recognition, etc. It is worth noting that we achieved high accuracy in all of them. I have implemented and develop deep networks in many libraries such as Caffe, Tensorflow, Torch, Keras and MatConvNet. Before all of them, I had a great deal of experience in traditional methods used in the field of Image processing.
