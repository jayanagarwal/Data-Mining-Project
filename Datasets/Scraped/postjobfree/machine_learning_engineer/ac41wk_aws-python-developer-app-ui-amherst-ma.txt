Projects
1)Improving Open Domain Dialogue-Systems (Chatbots)
Built an seq2seq neural conversational model in PyTorch using attention with intention and a diversity promoting objective function to prevent irrelevant boring outputs
2)Multilingual embeddings for cross-language NLP
Created language agnostic word embeddings via Artificial Code-Switching to run any NLP task for languages with very less labeled data
3)DSR Reinforcement Learning to navigate a Labyrinth
Applied successor representations within an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework, comparing its efficacy to DQN on a grid-world domain (Mazebase) on AWS EC2
4)Sarcasm Detection for Target-dependent Sentiment classification
Trained a model on twitter data to detect sarcasm using n-grams, sentiment scores and topic modeling (LDA) and used it to improve sentiment classification of Amazon reviews

Accomplishments
First place in Google Hackathon - Used Firebase and Google maps API to develop an app, InTheBin! that renders crowd-sourced locations of nearby trash cans
