HCL technologies
Completed a sentiment analysis mini-project that consisted of collecting and analyzing reviews and produced an overall review of the product.(Using JAVA and MySQL).
•
Collected numerous reviews of a restaurant from the web and stored them in the MySQL database.Then using asp.net, built a tool that removed the stop words and using MeaningCloud determined the sentiment of each review and displayed the total number of positive and negative reviews for the restaurant.

Big Data Project “Twitter sentiment analysis"
Leveraged my expertise on the subject to help my teammates understand the subject and led the team to successfully complete this challenging project.
•
Then using Apache Kafka to stream the performed sentiment analysis on the fly (live stream) from the producer to the consumer using StanfordNLP library to classify the tweets as
'positive','negative' or 'neutral' .
•
Classified 50,000 tweets and identified the number of tweets from each category originating from different states of USA using Elasticsearch's Kibana. [Python,Scala]

Big Data Project “Crime rate Forecasting System"
Used the Portland crime rate dataset which consisted of 829,384 rows and 19 columns which I clustered into three clusters using the Spark MLLIB(K-means clustering).
•
•Developed a time forecasting system on the three clusters using the ARIMA(Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model that forecasted the crime rate for one month with an accuracy of 80%. [Pyspark,Scala]
•
2018-05 E-commerce case study(Recommendation system) A case study to determine the reasonable complements given a product(adhesives&sealants) in a dataset of 2107537 rows(observations) 6 columns(variables).
•
• Preprocessed the dataset to avoid the user cold start problem in Rec engines. Built an effective item-based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System for an e- commerce company that recommends the top 'n' products for each product in the dataset.[Python]

Predicting if a user clicks on an advertisement
Cleaned an advertisement dataset that consisted of 19 features and a target variable(to be predicted).
•
Using various ML models(Logistic Regression,Decision Trees,Random Forests) built a prediction model that predicts whether a user is likely to click an ad or not.
•
Improved sales and website volume by identifying features that contributed positively towards a user clicking on an advertisement.

Object detection using TensorFlow
Led and helped the team understand the inner workings of TensorFlow with my excellent teaching skills.
•
• Used the TensorFlow API to successfully detect objects in an image/video. Trained new objects on the API(soccer ball) using Amazon EC2 for faster training(reduced training time by 20%).
•
Achieved a remarkable 94% accuracy on the test images and finally used this trained model to detect the objects in a video game ( GTA V, Watchdogs). [Python,Tensorflow]

Babysitter match system
Designed a software system for both parents and child-care takers where parents can finally find the best caretakers for their child using Spring MVC framework.
•
Websites were designed using HTML,Javascript and Bootstrap and was run on the Tomcat Server which acted as the interface for the users of the system,the websites were connected to the controller(written in JAVA) which was in turn connected to the MYSQL database.
•
• The project was designed using AGILE methodology. (SpringMVC,JAVA,Javascript,MYSQL). Education
