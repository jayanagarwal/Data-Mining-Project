Projects & Achievements
Achieved 1st position from 140 teams for the Implementation of (EmoAR) Facial Emotion Recognition model (7 classes) deployed on Android platform, for Facebook & Udacity Project Showcase challenge (Collaborated and led a team of 3 people).
Built Facial keypoint detection system to predict location of multiple distinguishing keypoints on the image of face.
Implemented CNN-RNN model trained with MS COCO dataset to automatically generate captions from Images.
Deployed a recurrent neural network on localhost using Amazon’s Sagemaker for predicting the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB dataset.
Implementing License plate recognition using OpenCV and tesseract OCR.
Generated with GANs, new images of faces from the celebrities dataset.
Constructed event pipeline around Apache Kafka to simulate and display status of train lines in real time.
Implemented Stacked Autoencoder and Deep Belief Network using TensorFlow. Applied greedy layer-wise training approach to train the models using NSL-KDD dataset. (2017) (Digital Engineering team Project). Scholarships & Certifications
