I have completed Master of Data Science(MSE) from Macquarie University, Australia in June 2021, and I also finished my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from United International University in 2018. I achieved second prize in Big Data Hackathon, Dec 2020 held at Macquarie University. I have about 5 year of job experience in the area of data engineering. During my time in a job, I designed and developed many data models using python and R. Part of my task was to collect and preprocess data and then apply machine learning on data. I also developed a web based software using html, javascript, css, angular js and bootstrap. Some of the developments were hospital management system, taxi cab service management and pharmacy management system. I also developed many NLP projects like a language identifier and a predictive text generator. During my job, I extensively used Python, AWS, Azure, Excel, SPSS, SAD and particularly .NET when I had to develop a website. I even used to teach junior machine learning engineers. I secured second position in Hackathon held in December, 2020, and recently, I have obtained another second prize in Big Data Hackathon, July 2021 held at Macquarie University which had an association with Microsoft, Sydney and ITIC. I have obtained a certificate titled “ AWS certified Solutions Architect Associate” in last year, 2020. During my training, I developed top AWS projects like deploying a Windows Virtual Machine, setting up Kubernetes Clusters on Amazon EC2 Spot, building a Content Recommendation System, using Lex to create Chatbots and training a Machine Learning Model with SageMaker. Throughout my data career, I did many DevOps projects, especially I have used many tools such as Selenium, Puppet, Chef, Git, Jenkins, Ansible and Docker. I even implemented CI/CD pipeline in both AWS and Azure. I know how to create a project using Jenkins. Also, during my master’s program, I did many data science projects which involved responsibilities of Data Validation, tagging and categorization. I can scrap websites, and I implemented such projects in my Master’s. Two of my projects were collecting some tweets, and conducting a data analysis along the lines of the one of Donald Trump's tweets and accessing both the Wikipedia page for a particular topic and its Talk page. I used numpy, tensorflow, scikitlearn, pandas and seaborn numerous times. I used Pytorch and OpenCV when I developed face age classifier and analysed privacy preservation of data using deep learning techniques. Throughout my job career and Master’s program, I used deep learning several times. I know the application of transformers such as BERT and GPT. I have 5 years of experience in Hadoop. I developed many Hive projects like building a data warehouse using Spark on Hive and analysis of airline dataset analysis using Hadoop, Hive, Pig and Impala. Currently, I am in Dhaka, Bangladesh actively looking for a job. My objective is to do tasks in a way that will benefit the industry.

WORK EXPERIENCE
Data Science Research Intern Optus Macquarie University Cybersecurity Hub Jan 2021 to Jun 2021 The Optus Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub promotes a uniquely interdisciplinary approach to tackle real-world challenges in cyber security. It forms a network of researchers, academic and business leaders. It is a platform for experts, researchers and tech leaders to act jointly for developing cyber security technology, digital governance and technology policy initiatives. Minimizing the pitfalls of human factors through digital technology initiatives is another focus area of the Hub. The scope includes conducting interdisciplinary research across several disciplines: computing, engineering, business, criminology, law and psychology. It also trains the next generation of cybersecurity specialists, and it makes industry leaders conscientious. Last, but not the least, it develops the skills of the existing workforce. It deals with developing commercial technology solutions for cybersecurity challenges with a focus on enabling trust in the digital economy, and core projects of the projects of the Hub involve building trust in Data, Technology, Systems and People.
• The goal of my internship research project was to explore the limitations of the existing privacy solutions for a particular dataset. Sitting on the side of an unauthorized deep-learning model, I designed and tested techniques for exploiting the user information even when privacy defenses were in place. The scope of this project was to explore differential privacy and membership inference attacks. With a theoretical understanding of how attack models work to leak the differentially private algorithms, the evaluations were made on available adversarial attack models. The evaluation exercise utilizing the available established data set revealed the scope and limitations of the available models. Suggestions for new strategies for improving the model performance were made from the analytical investigations of the model results. My work scope also included evaluation of privacy vulnerability of cloud based deep learning i.e. machine learning models on platforms like Google cloud and AWS. Google cloud AI models and AWS are popularly used by businesses and organizations for business intelligence, feature inferencing and process optimization. Therefore, cloud based AI models are commonly trained by agencies own data. If these cloud based AI models are not secured enough for member privacy leakage, the companies are automatically putting their customers privacy at risk. My job was to train such cloud based AI models with given datasets and later on, using the results of training and subsequent testing, I explored the privacy leakage potential of such AI models.
• After completing this internship, I became proficient in python, Google AI cloud, docker and AWS. In addition to that, I gained knowledge of differential privacy and how data can be preprocessed and managed before it is fed into any algorithms. In line with these learnings, I also learned that choosing an appropriate privacy budget parameter is an indispensable prerequisite to maintain privacy of person s data.
