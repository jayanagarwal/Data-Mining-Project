Scientific Research Jan. 2023 – Dec. 2023
Faculty of Information Science and Engineering Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
• Topic: RRS - Review-based Recommendation System Using Deep Learning for Vietnamese
• Description: We propose a recommendation system (RRS) combined with a Language Processing Model to capture context from Real-time Vietnamese comments. Our approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on small datasets.
• Technologies: Neural Collaborative Filtering, PhoBERT, FastText, LSTM, Keras, Numpy, Underthesea, Kafka, Spark, Cassandra.
• Responsibility:
- Perform information collection, preprocessing and data set construction.
- Applied research of FastText into the recommendation model.
- Deploy end-to-end ML pipelines with real-time comments and user history from a real website using Big Data technology.
• Status: The project is currently being submitted for the UIT School Award and accepted for publication in the
”SN Computer Science” Journal.
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
IR-Based Chatbot System with Custom Document and Image Dataset Nov. 2023 – Dec. 2023 Faculty of Information Science and Engineering Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
• Description: A chatbot system based on the RAG method can be used for chat with any document or image dataset.
• Technologies: CLIP, Faiss, LangChain, SQLite, ResNet50, VisionTransformer (ViT-L14), Sentence-BERT, GPT3.5, FLAN-T5, Streamlit.
• Responsibility:
- Design text to picture solution using CLIP for the system.
- Design picture to picture solution using ResNet50 for the system.
- Support building demo systems with Streamlit.
NAML-LSTUR: A Combinded Model for News Recommendation Jun. 2023 – Jul. 2023 Faculty of Information Science and Engineering Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
• Description: A recommendation model (NAML-LSTUR) for the News Recommendation is a combination of two SOTA models.
• Technologies: MIND dataset, LSTUR model, NAML model, DKN model, TANR model.
• Responsibility: Define architechture. Process data sets to suit computing resources. Connect the User Encoder of the LSTUR model and the News Encoder of NAML to create output for the system. CERTIFICATIONS
