Senior Machine Learning Engineer, CLOUDMEDX, Palo Alto Oct. 2019 - Current
• Designed and implemented AI applications using encoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) like Clinical BERT, effectively training and fine-tuning for Named Entity Recognition (NER) within healthcare data, which led to accurate ICD-9 code extraction from patient notes.
• Developed a FastAPI backend paired with a React frontend, incorporating AWS DynamoDB for data storage and retrieval. Utilized OpenAI GPT to auto-generate Python functions from MIPS rule files, enabling real-time patient rule verification.
• Designed a React frontend and FastAPI backend to construct a chatbot utilizing OpenAI's GPT API. This chatbot efficiently schedules doctor appointments and can answer patient-specific questions like copays or patient’s functional scores based on integrated patient files.
• Built the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model via Python to predict the Covid-19 cases. Developed C19 Explorer platform and C19 Vaccine tool.
Machine Learning Engineer, BYTON(Unicorn intelligent car start-up), Santa Clara Sep. 2018 - Sep. 2019
• Built deep convolutional neural network to estimate age, gender, emotion of drivers and passengers
• Used detected features of customers in-camera as cold starts to build a news feed application Research assistant, Jinfeng Zhang statistical research lab, Tallahassee, FL Sep. 2017 - Sep. 2018
• Retrieved relevant articles of protein-protein interactions (PPI) from the BioGrid database via python language.
• Built neural network and boosting models to determine which sentences contain information about PPI and aim to find new interactive protein pairs
