PROJECTS
2018 Digital Image Processing [C++, OpenCV]
Image Denoising, Creating Special Effects, Geometric Image Modification, Homographic Transformation, Morphological Processing, Texture Classification and Segmentation, Edge Detection, Image Matching Using SIFT/SURF, MNIST Classification/Comparison Using LeNet-CNN and Subspace Approximation and Augmented Kernels (SAAK) Transform. 2018 Bank Marketing Data Analysis [Python, Scikit-Learn] Explored supervised models to analyze and predict if a client will subscribe for a term deposit given his/her marketing campaign related data. Pre-processed dataset with missing values, handled class imbalance, and best model was fine tuned for hyper parameters by k-fold Cross Validation.
2018 Simulation Methods For Stochastic Systems [Python] Double Rejection, K-Means Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, Bag of Words Clustering, Monte Carlo Approximation and Integration, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Based Sampling, Optimization and Traveling Salesman Problem 2013 Topological Texture Feature Based Age Classification [MATLAB] Exploited different feature extraction methods to train a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier.The proposed methodology, was able to classify facial images into 6 age groups with 73 percentage of accuracy. 2013 Detection and Removal of Poisson noise in Low Light Images [MATLAB] Noise distribution was analyzed to set a threshold and identify images as noisy or noiseless. Transformation techniques were used to effectively denoise images.
2012 Weapon Detection in X-ray Images using Bayes classifier [MATLAB] Textural features from x-ray weapon images were extracted. Bayes Classifier was used to give timely alert of a concealed weapon and identify its location on the image of baggage.
