Personal Projects
Developer Team size: 2
Source:
Description: Develop a fast, accurate, lightweight Vietnamese speech recognition system that can recognize and transcribe spoken words into text using Wav2Vec2.0.
Technologies: Python, Transformers, Speechbrain, Wav2Vec2 Responsibilities: - Collected over 600 hours of raw speech data from multiple sources
- Improved performance by 20% with a customed tokenizer based on Vietnamese acoustic
- Achieved 96% accuracy on the clean test set and 90% accuracy on the noise test set Developer Team size: 1
Source:
Description: The project aimed to predict the correct capitalization and punctuation of text inputs, such as speech recognition output or messages. I used Sequence Tagging approach to tackle this problem. Technologies: Python, Transformers, NLP
Responsibilities: - Preprocessed the data by removing stopwords and performing normalization, tokenization
- Utilized pretrained BERT model for faster convergence and better accuracy
- Achieved 90% accuracy on the Capitalization task and 80% on the Punctuation task Developer Team size: 1
Source:
Description: Develop an inverse text normalization system to improve the accuracy of chatbot responses and speech recognition system.
Technologies: Python, NeMo, NLP
Responsibilities: - Used Finite State Transducer (FST) to map normalized text to its original spoken or written form, considering contextual and linguistic factors
