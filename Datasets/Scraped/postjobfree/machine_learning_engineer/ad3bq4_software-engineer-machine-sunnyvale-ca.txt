● Built machine learning models for forecasts using LSTMs and traditional ML algorithms.
● Constructed a fine-tuned LLM and integrated it into an iOS AI assistant application.
● Drove fine-tuning and prompt engineering for client LLMs.
● Architected, developed, tested, and deployed 100+ RESTful APIs, which have generated $300K+ in revenue.
● Developed a custom logging framework to monitor the health and status of 100+ RESTFul APIs.
● Enhanced 50+ existing APIs by adding logs to a custom logging framework. IT Developer/Engineer III Hewlett Packard Enterprise Roseville, CA, USA 04/2020 - 01/2022
● Led and architected the Tibco Migration project for the HRIT team by developing 40+ enterprise-level Python, Node JS, Hapi JS, and SnapLogic REST APIs and deploying them using the docker and Kubernetes-driven HPE Ezmral. This resulted in $1 million in annual license savings for HPE and saved $2 million+ of outsourcing.
● Enriched system metrics of all REST APIs by integrating Entmon logging frameworks.
● Designed, developed, and deployed the PMG to CMAP integration, which generated $100K+ for the team.

● Sheldon AI Assistant: Created an AI assistant that chats like Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory, leveraging the fine-tuning of GPT 3.5 Turbo. Results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model has adapted the characteristics of Sheldon, while GPT 3.5 Turbo is an emotionless AI assistant.
● Smit Shop (eCommerce): Developed an eCommerce platform using Django and Postgres backend and React JS frontend. Implemented a full-featured shopping cart, product reviews, rating capabilities, top products carousel, product pagination, a search feature, a user profile with orders, PayPal/credit card integration, and database storage. In addition, admin capabilities for product, user, and order management were added.
