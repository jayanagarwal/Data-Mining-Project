PERSONAL PROJECTS
1. Document Image Classiﬁcation on RVL-CDIP
Dataset
Detection of diﬀerent types of Document images and classify them in diﬀerent classes like letter, form, email, handwritten, advertisement, scientiﬁc report, scientiﬁc publication, speciﬁcation, ﬁle folder, news article, budget, invoice, presentation, questionnaire, resume, memo. So It is a Multi-class Classiﬁcation Problem or we can call it a Computer Vision task.
Tools used: Scikit-learn, Numpy, Seaborn, Pandas,
Matplotlib, Keras with Tensorﬂow backend, Jupyter
Notebook, Tensorboard.
2. Toxic Comment Classiﬁcation Challenge
Detection of diﬀerent types of Toxic Comments and classify them in diﬀerent classes like Toxic, Severe_Toxic, Obscene, Threat, Insult and Identity Hate. But a Single comment can be classiﬁed in multiple classes. So it is a Multilabel Classiﬁcation Problem.
Tools used: Scikit-learn, Numpy, Seaborn, Pandas,
Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, Keras with Tensorﬂow backend,
