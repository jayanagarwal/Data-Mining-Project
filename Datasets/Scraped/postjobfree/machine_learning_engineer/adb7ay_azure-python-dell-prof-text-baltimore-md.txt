PROJECTS:
● Led IBM Cognitive Security project to digest, learn from, build knowledge-graph and reason over vast amounts of structured and unstructured natural language data to quickly discover how to protect against the next zero-day exploit.
● Performed data mining, feature extraction, feature engineering and built shallow neural-networks for predictive modelling tasks on Kaggle datasets as part of course and research-work.
● Led team of 3 on SemEval 2018 Affect in Tweets Task, contributing towards determining the intensity of emotion expressed in tweets on a continuous and discrete scale, by using ensemble learning approach, namely Linear regression, SVM and CNN.
● Developed an intelligent system that analyzes natural language text, extracts relations among entities to find probable product vulnerabilities and recommends the least vulnerable product. GRADUATE ASSISTANTSHIPS
