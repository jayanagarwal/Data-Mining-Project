Fast 3D Human Pose Estimation
• Addressed stereo reconstruction problem by developing 3D pose estimation model from scratch in pytorch.
• Boosted the model’s performance by achieving a substantial 25% reduction in per-joint error compared to the paper’s approach. Improved by the use of a customized loss, masking data augmentation, and gradient clipping. Image to Image Translation
• Implemented generative models producing images with diverse styles and photo-realism features in pytorch.
• Mitigated mode collapse problem through investigating in training strategies. Achieved optimal diverse style results by leveraging BicycleGAN and best photo-realistic images by Soft-Intro VAE model. Rotated Object Detection for Remote Sensing
• Refined YOLOv4 for oriented object detection task by integration of a modified objective and head structure.
• Improving the model performance and achieved 93% MAP by leveraging the mosaic9 data augmentation and examined different metric functions like Kalman Filter IOU, Circular Smooth Label loss. Mini-Minecraft Game
• Designed an interactive 3D game and alteration program in the style of Minecraft game in C++.
• Developed the player physics (collision, mouse controlling), utilized OpenGL for texture rendering and handled efficiently multi-threaded landscape generation.
Penn-OS
• Designed a User-level Linux-like Operating System from scratch, including kernel, file system(FAT style) and shell interface in C within Docker environment.
• Contributed to the kernel and user level functionalities of system. The operating system support context switching, error logging, signal handler and multi-processing scheduler. Skills
