Qualcomm - Modem System Test Engineer - Functional Team - San Diego, CA Mar 21 - Present
• Developed expertise across various 5G areas like Sub6(NSA, SA) and mmWave(NSA, NRDC) as a part of the 5G functional feature integration team.
• Implemented test plan to validate 3GPP expectations for PHY, MAC, and RRC layers for functional call flows such as NR2NR Mobility, Peak Throughput, and RLF.
• Tested New UE features pertaining to Dynamic Spectrum Sharing(DSS), CDRX, ULCA, DLCA, Non-Contiguous frequency coreset, DMRS,PDCCH, and PDSCH.
• Debugged UE logs using postprocessing tools like QXDM, LAF and APEX on test simulators such as Keysight,Topcat,Wildcat. Analyzed modem stack and cellular technologies logs to identify the issues in call-flows, BLER, RLF’s, CSF, RSRP/SNR fluctuations and verify the solution.
• Worked on Python scripting for automating test cases using custom frameworks MTFpy and NextGen.
• Led the Ericsson, ZTE and Nokia OTA live testing and automated test scenarios like BWP, CA, add/release, activation/deactivation.
• Configured Keysight scripts to reproduce customer and field issues in the lab using the UE logs provided.
• Brought up multiple test setups for various test equipments such as Keysight,Topcat,Wildcat and OTA for different configuration areas like NRDC,FR1,FR2.
