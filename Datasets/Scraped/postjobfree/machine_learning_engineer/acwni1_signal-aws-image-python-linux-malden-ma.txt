Experience
Signal Processing Engineer Whoop
February 2016 – present (5 months) Boston, MA
Whoop is a start up that produces wrist wearable high end heart rate monitors for athletes. Developing heart rate algorithms in Python, and porting these algorithms to C for incorporation into the Whoop App. This is the most accurate device on the market and is worn by athletes such as LeBron James, Matthew Delladova, and Michael Phelps.

June 2014 – February 2016 (1 year 9 months) Cambridge, MA Quanttus was a start up that attempted to measure blood pressure with a device integrated into a wrist watch.
Translated proprietary algorithms for estimating blood pressure written as Matlab code into C++. Acted as the bridge between the research group (mainly working in Matlab) and firmware group
(embedded C Identified inefficiencies, and reworked the algorithms. For example, doubled the speed of regressions by rewriting the peak finder to use a double ended queue. Also, rewrote a portion of the ARM real FFT code to halve memory usage.

Lead Algorithm Developer Huron Digital Pathology
August 2011 – May 2014 (2 years 10 months) Waterloo, Ontario, Canada Huron develops slide scanners to generate images of pathology slides. Slides can be several centimeters across and be imaged at a resolution of 0.25 microns. Image size is typically 50GB. My role was to develop image processing algorithms to improve image quality.
• Wavelets: Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform C++ code. 1. Tumor Detection: Computed DTCWT based features used to locate tumors in slides. The results agree well with tumors marked out by a trained pathologist. 2. Fast image fusion using wavelets: image stacks comprising 20 or more Z planes, each of which may be in focus in one part of the image only, can be fused into a single image that is in focus everywhere. Used on slides containing non biological specimens.
• Dynamic Slope to develop focus map. Applied Optimization Theory (e.g. minimum curvature or minimum slope criteria) to instruct the external controller to vary the angle of the scan to maintain focus over as wide an area as possible.
• Red Green Blue registration using mutual information.
• Jitter detection and correction: row by row registration using mutual information/cross correlation/FFT phase difference.
• Photobleach Removal, White Balance Correction and Flat Field Correction.
• Automatic focus dot, slope line and white balance box placement.
• Removal of outliers from focus points using robust regression (e.g. RANSAC).
• Focus peak detection (Savitzky Golay Smoothing Filters, root finding in 1st derivative). C++, Matlab, FFT, Wavelets, Image Processing, Optimization, Visual Studio, Linux. Director of Algorithm Development Quantason
February 2010 – March 2011 (1 year 2 months) Philadelphia Navy Yard, PA Quantason was a start up dedicated to using ultrasound to detect breast micro calcifications, believed to be a precursor to breast tumors.
Signal and Image Processing expert, Software Developer and Linux System Administrator. Medical Device Development:
• Advanced signal processing and image analysis. Measurement of channel impulse response using chirp and m sequences. Location of breast calcifications by solving non linear system of equations involving optimization of a cost function.
• Administering intranet, CGI, scripting, version control, unit tests and backups. Matlab, Python, Linux, Apache, PHP, CGI, Subversion. Quantitative Developer DE Shaw & Co
February 2008 – December 2009 (1 year 11 months) New York City, NY DE Shaw & Co is a Hedge Fund located in New York City off Times Square. The hiring process is highly selective, fewer than 0.25% of applicants are eventually hired. Pricing reinsurance contracts (using Monte Carlo simulations) and optimizing portfolios.
• Designed database schema.
• Used in house SQL Alchemy Toolbox.
• Sped up reinsurance work. For example, the impact of a new contract on risk limits could be computed in a few minutes (rather than taking several hours).
• Risk Reports for the Executive Committee and Investor Risk Breakdown.
• Engineered synthetic data.
Python, SQL, Monte Carlo, Finance.
Lead Algorithm Developer GE Healthcare
April 2005 – January 2007 (2 year 9 months) Piscataway, NJ Algorithm Developer for the Instrumentation Group developing software for the InCell 1000 microscope. The algorithms automated the process of carrying out clinical assays for testing the efficacy of experimental drugs in high throughput assays.
• Optical Sectioning Algorithm: Devised a novel optical section algorithm using three or more images that is more reliable, faster and gives better results than any competitive product on the market. This work was showcased when the CEO of GE visited the site and received good reviews from the editor of the Journal of Microscopy.
• Image Denoising: Combined Bayesian Thresholding with the DTCWT to yield an effective method of denoising images. The method is especially impressive at cleaning up transmitted light images.
• Cell Tracking: Developed a customized method of tracking the movement of hundreds of cells across time frames using Monte Carlo based particle filters.
• Bead Analysis: In Microscopy, images of microscopic (polystyrene) beads are used to measure confocality, parfocality and well curvature. Developed a first of its kind computer program that automated the tedious manual process of measuring bead position, intensity, height and width. This task involved robust estimation, curve fitting and specialized segmentation, in addition to writing an intuitively obvious GUI.
• Image Stitching: Devised a fast robust image stitching method that works on fluorescent images of cell and tissue samples and brightfield images of Zebra fish. A standard method of image stitching (SIFT) did not work at all on these image samples. C++, Matlab, FFT, Wavelets, Image Processing, Visual Studio, Linux. Research Programmer GenuOne
November 2000 – February 2005 (4 years 4 months) Princeton, NJ Making it safe to shop on the Internet. Detecting and identifying rogue web sites:

• Digital Authenticator: Worked in developing a first of its kind tool to authenticate web sites.
• TraceGuard: Aided work in overt and covert, machine readable marking technologies to provide authentication, tracking and control capabilities for clients. Backend:
• Kleinberg's hubs and authorities algorithm (sparse SVD C++ called from Java). One interesting result: people wearing fake watches in England were interested in yachts, while in Japan they were interested in golf.
• Hofmann's Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis and Deerwester's SVD based LSA.
• Decision Trees extracted from database tables.
• A multithreaded web crawler written in Python.

Member of Technical Staff Siemens Corporate Research October 1998 – November 2000 (2 years 2 months) Princeton, NJ Researched and developed a wide variety of adaptive technologies for a variety of applications including Demand Forecasting, Data Mining, Blind Source Separation for Hearing Aids. The Hearing Aid Project involved finding a scheme to separate two people talking at the same time in different places in a room into two channels with only one person speaking on each channel. The solution had to fit on a device with 1MHz processor and 1.2K of RAM. This was accomplished by recognizing that only cross correlations up to 11 lags were needed.
• Negotiated contracts and maintained customer contacts. Acted as the primary contact between SCR and project customers.
• All contracted projects were delivered on time and within budget. Matlab, Signal Processing, Independent Component Analysis, Phase Arrays, Time Series Analysis.

November 1994 – July 1996 (1 years 8 months) Dublin, Ireland Research in watermarking, copyright protection techniques and security systems.
• Digital Communications: Understood that watermarking was a problem in digital communications. Implemented a spread spectrum CDMA system for secure and robust encoding of the watermark. Experimented with Convolutional Codes and Reed Solomon Forward Error Correction Codes.
• Novel Use of Image Transforms: Applied transform domain techniques to yield information bearing pulses that could withstand distortion during watermark transmission. Desirable properties included resistance to distortion by image compression, reproduction using a scanner, dithering and image cropping. Developed watermarks that are simultaneously invariant to rotation, changes of scale and cropping as well as being resistant to other forms of image modification.
• Encryption and Secure Communications: Supervised the design of a Java based interface suitable for legally binding registration of digital watermarks over an open network such as the Internet.
