Experience Summary
2 years of deep learning and 7 years of rich software engineering experience across di erent technology.
• Worked on di erent computer vision tasks such as pedestrian detection and tracking, semantic segmentation, saliency prediction through transfer learning, visualization of deep networks, tweaked pre-trained CNN models(VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50) and used OpenCV to solve speciﬁc problems.
• Experienced in implementing various model-free reinforcement learning algo- rithms such as Q-learning, SARSA, policy gradients in a manner that can solve the problems formulated as MDP.
• Worked on continuous delivery and continuous integration tools such as jenkins, Mesosphere/ Marathon, cron jobs using DC/OS and docker for platform agnostic applications.
• Proﬁcient with HPC frameworks(for instance SLURM, LSF) used for e cient shared GPU cluster(s) management across team.
• Writer at Towards Data science medium community and write posts on AI/ML/DL topics. I publish my blogs intermittently at nilesh0109.medium.com Work Experience

Past Projects
2020-now "Enhancing Label E ciency for semantic segmentation tasks using self-supervised learning" BCAI, Renningen
Using BYOL for pretraining on 20k unlabelled street view images in self-supervised manner, got 10% improvement in mIOU(0.65 to 0.74) on cityscapes val dataset. Used baselines architecture of FCN8s and deeplabv3plus with Resnet50 as backbone.
