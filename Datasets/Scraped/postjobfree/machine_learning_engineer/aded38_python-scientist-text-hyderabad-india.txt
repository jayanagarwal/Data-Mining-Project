1. Chest-X-Rays Detection
In this project, We worked on convolutional neural network to detect and classify diagnoses of patients. The CNN was trained using Keras, with the TensorFlow backend. The model is similar to the VGG architectures, 2 to 3 convo- lution layers are used in each set of layers, followed by a pooling layer. Dropout is used in the fully connected layers only, which slightly improved the results.
• Technologies - CNN, Opencv(computer vision) and python
• Tools - Spyder, Anaconda
2. Website Chatbot
In this project, We worked on Fuzzy-wuzzy library for matching the user’s question with my question-bank .csv file and returning an answer if match is more than 80 out of 100 otherwise we show similar question. This will find the nearest matching question in the question column of .csv file and return the answer along with other details.
• Technologies - Fuzzywuzzy, Flask, Natural language processing and Python
• Tools - Jupyter-notebook
3. Person Tagging
In this project, We worked onwhenthepersonisdetectedbycamerathenthepersonisautomaticallytaggedasun- known or if the face is also recognized by camera then the person is tagged as name of the personwhoisrecognized by camera.
• Technologies - CNN, Opencv(computer vision), dlib and Python
• Tools - Spyder, Anaconda
4. Fire Detection
In this project, We worked on convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying fire in videos and features vector to classify whether a frame is fire or not and tested on real video sequences.
• Technologies - Opencv, VGG16, Tensorflow, Keras
• Tools - Spyder, Anaconda
5. Language Translation
In this project, we worked on translation of English sentence to other language sentence (French, Spain & German) using a LSTM based architecture.Here, we passed English sentence words passed at the LSTM input layer and cor- responding other language words generated at the output layer.
• Technologies - Natural Language Processing, RNN, Word2vec
• Tools - Pycharm, Anaconda
