ACADEMIC RESEARCH PROJECTS (More Details: https://www.linkedin.com/in/himani-bedekar/)
Cognitive IoT for Medical Analysis- Thesis based on Machine Learning
Developed the Disease prediction system with the help of machine learning algorithms such as Support vector machine(SVM) and feedforward backpropagation multilayer neural network(NN) gaining high accuracy with very less mean square error(MSE) performed on two medical datasets. Obtained the results in python and R programming.
Project Duration Prediction( Software Project Management)– Model building in Matlab
Compared Linear Regression(LR) and Gaussian Process(GP) machine learning algorithms in terms of correlation coefficients for the successful software project predictions from the data. Gaussian process proved to be a good fit for the performance of the designed model.
Blind Image Blur Estimation- Via Deep Learning
Implemented a learning-based method using a pre-trained deep neural network(DNN) and a general regression neural network(GRNN) on a number of real images. First successfully classified the blur type and then estimated its category taking advantages of both classification and regression.
Network Routing- With Artificial Neural Network in TensorFlow
Proposed the design of the artificial neural network for the routing in the sensor network using TensorFlow.
Realized the more faster operation by replacing the routing table with trained ANN.
Image Segmentation and Preprocessing- Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach
Followed the preprocessing on images and analyzed K-means clustering ML algorithm for segmentation of those images. Also Performed the Brain tumor Segmentation using k-means clustering in MATLAB.
