Idelji Corporation, Santa Monica, CA, USA Sep 2022 – present Machine Learning and Software Engineer
● Utilized deep learning architectures (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) in conjunction with Prophet, random forest, and XGBoost to forecast over 16 000 stationary and non-stationary time series with a mean accuracy of 94.85%
● Applied statistics-inspired algorithms and combinatorial result optimization to utilize the strengths of diﬀerent predictions
● Built the ML pipeline via MySQL and AWS, integrated the predictive feature into the Remote Analyst product
● Added automated exception reporting for customers’ system monitoring ease, thereby reducing downtime on their end Odame Lab, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA Sep 2019 – Apr 2020 Research Assistant (RA)
● Collected patient respiratory signals via a respiratory belt, compared results to (invasive) pulmonary function tests (PFT), used ML tools to solve the inverted prediction problem of obtaining PFT forecasts from non-invasive respiratory belt data
● The achieved correlation coeﬃcient of ~0.93 convinced the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center to reduce patient visit frequency by a quarter, thereby reducing the need for invasive PFTs by 75% and leading to greater patient comfort PUBLICATIONS
● Sezer, O., Horsﬁeld, A. P. (2023) The Cellular Phase Field Method. Manuscript in preparation
● Rees, C.A., Nasir, M., Smolinska, A., Sezer, O., et al. (2018) Detection of high-risk carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae isolates using volatile molecular proﬁles. Scientiﬁc Reports, Volume 8. PROJECTS
● Educated Guess (Oct 2022 - present): A passion project utilizing NLP (sentiment analysis) and continuous exponential interpolation to feature engineer stock market time series data. Employed deep learning architectures and statistical approaches to classify stock behavior enhanced by novel regression approaches.
● Dissertation (Sep 2021): Implemented the novel Cellular Phase Field Method combining corrosion modeling techniques like cellular automata, ﬁnite diﬀerence, and the phase ﬁeld method in 2 and 3D. Wrote an eﬃcient phase- and space-aware system of chemical reactions solver to supplement existing corrosion modeling literature. Performed physical constant optimization via supervised learning with respect to experimental data and simulation results.
● CNN for X-Ray Classiﬁcation (May 2021): Designed deep CNNs via PyTorch for the classiﬁcation of lung X-ray images into COVID-19, lung opaqueness, pneumonia, and healthy. Final AUC-ROC value achieved is 98.16%. LEADERSHIP & ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Seed Education Aug 2017 – Sep 2019
Founder and President
● Founded a non-proﬁt mentoring platform for high school students from underprivileged backgrounds
● Seed Education received initial funding ($2,500) from the Dartmouth Entrepreneurial Network (DEN) and presented the organization at the United Nations Youth Assembly in February 2018 Dartmouth International Student Association, Hanover, NH, USA Jun 2017 - Sep 2018 President
● Represented the international student body at receptions and dinners with the Trustees of Dartmouth
● Secured $5,250 in funding for the 2017-2018 academic year, a nearly 65% increase from the previous budget
● Promoted the organization and increased number of active members from 125+ to 350+ SKILLS & INTERESTS
