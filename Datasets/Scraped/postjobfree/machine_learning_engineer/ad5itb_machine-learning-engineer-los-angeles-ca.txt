Machine Learning Engineer
• Spearheaded the development of a bespoke search algorithm for the small molecule virtual space, resulting in an approximately 10% increase in hit rates across 5 pre-clinical projects.
• Engineered chemical property models utilizing ensemble architecture and transfer learning techniques, increasing prediction accuracy by 15% and rapidly accelerating drug discovery timelines.
• Led the deployment of models using MLFlow and serverless inference endpoints, reducing time to deployment into the drug development pipeline from days to minutes.
• Established and trained a proprietary large-language model as a “foundation” molecular embedding model, enhancing the organization's capabilities in molecular representation learning and increasing downstream model performance by 8%.
• Orchestrated computational workloads on distributed clusters using Spark and Sagemaker Pipelines, resulting in a 90% reduction in runtime cost.
sFOX August 2022 – October 2022
Software Engineer Intern
• Enhanced users' digital wallet security by implementing a state-of-the-art multi-party computation (MPC) security layer, bolstering protection against unauthorized access.
• Containerized the security layer using Docker and Kubernetes, facilitating seamless deployment to production environments.
Buonomano Lab, UCLA October 2019 – June 2022
Computational Neuroscience Research Assistant
• Published a computational neuroscience paper on interval timing mechanisms, serving as the first author in a peer- reviewed journal publication.
• Developed a biologically-inspired recurrent neural network (RNN) in Python using TensorFlow, utilized for modeling timing and working memory tasks.
• Leveraged MATLAB for in-depth analysis of network dynamics and generation of data-driven insights into neural representations of timing and working memory.
