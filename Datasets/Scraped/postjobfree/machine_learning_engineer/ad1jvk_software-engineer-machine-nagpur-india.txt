• End to end chicken disease classification : Created an user web application to predict chicken disease by analyzing a photo of the chicken’s fecal matter. Implemented convolutional neural network with VGG-16 architecture model, Achieved an accuracy of 0.94 with a loss of 0.58 with hyperparameter tuning. Containerised the application using Docker and implemented CI/CD pipeline production grade deployment on AWS with amazon EC2 instance and amazon ECR using GitHub actions. Source code
• End to end student score prediction : Created an user web application to predict the student’s subject score by uploading other parameters Used MySQL for data ingestion. Created a Linear Regression model with R2 score of 0.8908 and hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation using GridsearchCV. Containerised the application using Docker and implemented CI/CD pipeline deployment on AWS with amazon EC2 instance and amazon ECR using GitHub actions. Source code
• Driver drowsiness detection : Created a detection system that identifies key attributes of drowsiness and triggers an alert when someone is drowsy before it is too late. Used OpenCV for real time face detection to capture eye images. Used convolutional neural network model with ReLu and Softmax as activation functions and successfully achieved an accuracy of 92.36% Source code Education Bachelor of Engineering
