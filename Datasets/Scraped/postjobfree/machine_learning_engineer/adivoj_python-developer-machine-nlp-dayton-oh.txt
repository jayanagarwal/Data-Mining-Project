Corporate Experience
Programmer, Wright State University, Dayton, OH May 2019 – July 2019
• Worked on the RESCHU Project in the psychology department Lab funded by the Wright Patterson Air Force Base.
• Developed the code which was written in java and tweaked a few parameters as per the requirement by the professor.
• Duties include capturing the data and storing in the database based on the trigger of the events and additionally, sending out the port codes to trigger an event.
Programmer Analyst, Cognizant, Chennai, India June 2016 – July 2018
• Worked for the client Cigna, a health insurance company with a team of three for a .NET development project.
• Designed, developed, and maintained a web application in ASP.NET technologies –both frontend and backend.
-Technologies used: C#, SQL, HTML and CSS.
• Automated a tool that generates weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual reports internally for the company and which exhibits the KPI metrics to the client.
• Worked with the Managers and Data Scientists to frame the problem, both mathematically and within the business context.
• Develop prototypes and validate the results and try to define new KPI metrics using Machine Learning to move from automation to augmentation.
Academic Projects
SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON TWITTER DATA (twitter API, python, Naïve Bayes and RNN) Nov 2019- Dec 2019
• Performed Sentiment Analysis on tesla tweets that are collected from twitter using the twitter API interface.
• Trained the model using the Sentiment140 dataset which contains 1.4 million tweets. The sentiment analysis will classify the tweets into positive, negative, and neutral tags.
• Worked with the two models multinomial Naïve Bayes and RNN. The Bag of words model and count vectorizer are used in naïve Bayes whereas Fast text and bidirectional LSTM are used in RNN.

SIMILARITY OF THE DOCUMENTS (Python, Keras, TensorFlow, LSTM) Nov 2019- Dec 2019
• The training document contains sentences and their similarity value to train the model and further text preprocessing is done.
• The word vectors are embedded using the pre-trained glove vector of embedded size 50 and the input is fed into LSTM.
• The optimizer used is Adam Optimizer and the Mean Square Error is the metric used to evaluate the performance. IMPLEMENTATION OF SEARCH ENGINE (python, scikit learn, matplotlib) Feb 2019 – Mar 2019
• Implemented on the 20 mini newsgroup datasets and TF-IDF is used in text mining.
• Evaluated the performances of the classification algorithms Multinomial MB, Bernoulli NB, KNN, and SVM classifiers.
• Implemented Feature selection methods chi2, mutual_info_classif, and selectkBest.
• Measured the clustering quality of the Clustering algorithms K Means and hierarchical clustering using silhouette Coefficient and Normalized mutual information (NMI). IMPLEMENTATION OF CORE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FROM SCRATCH (Python, matplotlib, NumPy) Feb 2020 – Mar 2020
• Implemented basic clustering, regression, and deep neural network algorithms.
• Implemented the following algorithms : K-Means, Fuzzy-C Means, linear and logistic regression, neural network
(forward and backward propagation).
• Resolved the overfitting of the model by implementing Lasso and Ridge regularizations. AWS HANDS ON EXPERIENCE (python, boto3 ) July 2020 - Sep 2020
• Connecting to AWS services using python library boto3 and performing basic operations.
• By using serverless REST API and lambda to trigger POST, UPDATE, DELETE AND GET operations in DynamoDB. Paper Publication
• R. Bhaktavatchalu, B. S. Rekha, G. A. Divya and V. U. S. Jyothi, "Design of AXI bus interface modules on FPGA," 2016 International Conference on Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies (ICACCCT), Ramanathapuram, 2016, pp. 141-146, doi: 10.1109/ICACCCT.2016.7831617. Independent Study
Research Paper on Learning Algorithms in Internet Routing. ( 3 credit Course work)
• This paper gives a general idea about data, feature engineering, supervised models, and reinforcement models.
• The general network protocol designs which depend on the algorithm selected by the humans considered efficient can be replaced by the Machine Learning Algorithms. These Machine Learning Algorithms can be applied in the most difficult task of networking which is routing.
• The following topics were discussed in the paper: Network Congestion, Congestion Control, Routing Algorithms, Q- routing, Neural Network Routes.
