Projects
POLICY GRADIENTS, PERSONAL — 2019
LANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS USED: PYTHON, JULIA, C++, PYTORCH, TENSORFLOW, FLUX, OPEN AI GYM Implemented the policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm to solve a wide variety of environments in the Open AI Gym library. The goal of this project was to compare different machine learning libraries across several metrics. To achieve this the project was rebuilt in Python using both PyTorch and TensorFlow, Julia using Flux, and C++ using PyTorch.
SENIOR CAPSTONE, NIKE — 2019
LANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS USED: PYTHON, TENSORFLOW, PANDAS, DJANGO Utilized deep convolutional neural networks and transfer learning to train a model on the deep fashion dataset that can recognize the category, color, and attributes of clothing in images. Taught machine learning to several students in my group, helping them to build high performance models both in terms of accuracy and training time. HUMAN PROTEIN ATLAS IMAGE CLASSIFICATION, KAGGLE — 2018 LANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS USED: PYTHON, TENSORFLOW, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB Built and compared several deep convolutional neural network architectures to classify mixed patterns of proteins in microscope images. Wrote significant report with collaborators detailing our findings. MELANOMA CLASSIFIER, PERSONAL — 2018
LANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS USED: PYTHON, JAVASCRIPT, TENSORFLOW, DJANGO, REACT Created a drag and drop user interface for designing neural network architectures. It allowed for training models on distributed machines with GPU acceleration from the browser. The results of the various architectures could be tracked as a function of training time and number of epochs to quickly iterate on the best models. Experience
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, WFG NATIONAL TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY — APRIL 2016 - SEPTEMBER 2017 LANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS USED: PHP, JAVASCRIPT, WORDPRESS, REACT, NODE Became sole developer after two weeks of training. Quickly built understanding of the large codebase and maintained several company websites. Initiated and implemented several automation pipelines. Created large time savings by removing the need for manual updates as changes occurred throughout the company, instead these automatically propagated to the correct parts of each website.
