ACADEMIC PROJECT

AUDIO TO SIGN LANGUAGE CONVERTER

-This project is about making an easy conversation with a deaf person.
-Consumes Human Audio as input and thereby converts human speech into a video of signs that deaf humans can understand.
-Applied Google's Speech recognition module is available in Python that consumes audio as input and converts audio into text format.
-The text string that is generated by the module is mapped to the background images.
- Employed Python’s CV2 module to create the video here.
