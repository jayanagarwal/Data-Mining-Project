SUMMARY
As a skilled Cloud DevOps Engineer with 8+ years of experience, I am committed to delivering robust and scalable solutions for complex cloud infrastructures. My expertise lies in designing and implementing cloud architectures, automating processes, and ensuring high availability and reliability of critical systems. I have a deep understanding of cloud platforms such as AWS and a proven track record of successful cloud migrations, deployments, and optimizations. With strong skills on infrastructure as code tools like Terraform and cloudformation, I have implemented numerous CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows, reducing deployment times and increasing productivity. I possess excellent communication and collaboration skills, working effectively with cross-functional teams, and providing technical guidance to stakeholders. As a driven individual, I am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies to stay ahead of the curve.
