NJR was in the midst of a high-level application re-engineering and re-architecture. The solution was to include several application systems like Maximo, Clevest, DayForce and others that will assign people to records within those systems. For instance, one person will be assigned to a work order in Maximo, which is sent to Clevest, that will schedule and dispatch that person based on the shift information and their timesheet will be created in Dayforce against that work order and sent back to Maximo to record labor costs against the work order. For this to happen all the major applications had to be integrated with Active Directory to work seamlessly and accurately.
