Master of Science in Information Technology (3.90 /4.0) University of Kansas August 2022 – May 2024
Bachelor of Technology in Electrical and Communication Engineering (3.5/4.0) VNR Vignan Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology June 2016 – July 2020 PROJECTS HANDLES
! Human Action Recognition Using Optical Flow : Human action classification is a process of classifying the image sequences with labels . The human activity classification is a key enabler in the development of many applications such as smart rooms, interactive virtual reality systems, people monitoring and environment modeling.Approaches for classification of human activities are typically based on information captured by cameras and sensors.Two essential categories of approaches of human action recognition distinguished: Wearable sensors based and vision based methods. This work is going to address the classification of human action based on vision. This vision based approach uses human body information which will be extracted from video sequences for classifying human actions.
! Brain Gate: The Brain Gate system, a scientific milestone, allows a quadriplegic man to control a computer using his thoughts. This system uses CyberKinetics platform technology to sense, transmit, analyze, and apply the language of neurons. Rain signals are generated with intact brain function, interpreted and translated into cursor movements. The system contains spikes implanted beneath the skull, monitoring activity from a small group of neurons. Patients with spinal cord injuries can produce brain signals that relay the intention of moving their limbs, output as electronic impulses, enabling them to operate mechanical devices with a computer cursor. ACHIEVEMENTS
● Awarded All India Best Startup Award at Bangalore, India (3rd Runner)
● Awarded best IEEE Computer Society Vice Chairman
● Organized BlockChain for sophomore students and introduce importance of Blockchain
● 3rd Runner Winner in Hackathon at University of Kansas
