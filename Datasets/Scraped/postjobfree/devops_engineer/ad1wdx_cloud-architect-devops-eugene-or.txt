Chockstone Inc / Heartland Payment Systems.
Sr QA Automation Engineer
Portland Oregon.
Designed our automation frameworks, finally settling on one written in Java/Groovy at the request of our Java development team. Integrated these frameworks into our Jenkins build server, and provided nightly test runs with reports. These tests provides us over 300 unique
“known state” environments to facilitate manual testing of any conditions, or investigation into databases the next day if any errors occured.
I was initially hired as a contractor into a team of 5 QA engineers. I was eventually given a full time potion once my second contract ended. After the rest of the QA team was laid off, I continued to run the department without assistance for 6 months. Once we were integrated into Heartland I hired and trained the new QA Lead while I continued to expand and maintain the automation suite.
Towards the end of my employment at Chockstone I began to step into a role which focused on engineering production support, product design, and third party integration. During that time I supported multiple third party payment processor integrations, one of which had over 2,300 locations nationally.
