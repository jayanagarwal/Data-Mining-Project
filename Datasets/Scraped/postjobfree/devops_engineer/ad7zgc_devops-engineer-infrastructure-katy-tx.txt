Project: Comprehensive Cloud Platform Transformation Objective:
Transform the company's application environment by creating a robust, scalable, and secure cloud platform using AWS and Azure, incorporating Infrastructure as Code, automation, and multi-cloud strategies. Responsibilities:
o Architected and deployed a hybrid cloud infrastructure incorporating AWS, enabling seamless data communication, sharing, storage, and backup, which resulted in a 30% increase in system reliability and a 25% decrease in operational costs. o Utilized Terraform to provision and manage cloud resources, automating the creation of EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 storage on AWS
o Directed comprehensive AWS infrastructure rollouts using Terraform, establishing a cohesive resource management framework that boosted operational efficiency by 35% and reduced manual intervention by 45% o Streamlined infrastructure deployment by embedding Terraform workflows into Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, cut manual intervention by almost, ensuring timely and accurate delivery of infrastructure changes for each code commit. o Enhanced application scalability by 40% through automated provisioning of AWS Lambda services via Terraform provider plugins, significantly reducing manual intervention and deployment time by 75%. o Leveraging Ansible for configuration management, I oversaw the installation and configuration of Jenkins, Apache, Nginx, and other important applications in cloud settings. o Regulated compute resources to employ resource tagging and autoscaling techniques to achieve a 20% increase in both performance and cost-efficiency.
o After-implementation support was provided, problems were fixed, and system improvements based on user input were put into place.
Key Achievements:
o Successfully transformed the application environment, resulting in a 40% increase in system reliability and a 30% reduction in operational costs.
o Automated 85% of infrastructure provisioning and management tasks, significantly improving efficiency and reducing time-to market for new services.
o Strengthened security and compliance through the implementation of robust IAM policies and automated security audits and incident response protocols.
