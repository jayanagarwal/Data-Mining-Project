CAREER SUMMARY
With over 12 years of experience as an infrastructure engineer at SITA and 20+ years of experience with Linux
(RHEL/CentOS), I have developed and maintained a wide range of cloud and bare-metal systems for database systems and applications, using Azure, Linux, Oracle, and vSphere technologies. I am familiar with bash scripting, python programming, and ansible automation tool. I have also demonstrated technical leadership, system design, installation, configuration, monitoring, management, troubleshooting, and administration skills, as well as excellent communication and collaboration abilities with technical and non-technical customers. PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Sabbatical - October 2022- Present
I took time off in October 2022 to recover from illness after which I decided to spend time with family. During my sabbatical at home, I have kept my skills relevant through self-study, volunteering, and assisting small businesses with website design and maintenance. In that time, I obtained the Azure AZ900 and the prestigious AZ104 Microsoft certifications and currently pursuing the RHCSA (Redhat Certified Systems Administrator). I have a passion for learning new technologies and solving complex problems. I am currently seeking a challenging Linux automation/DevOps position where I can leverage my professional experience and skill set and contribute to the success of innovative and dynamic organizations.
