PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Cloud Solutions Engineer (NBC Universal) Jan. 2021 – present

Interacted with various business user groups to understand their business processes, and by this understand the gaps and ideal state.

Used LucidChart to develop architectural diagrams before implementation and to give customers and clients a visual workflow of what they require.

Used Jira to plan, track, support, and close requests, tickets, and incidents.
Implemented security best practices in AWS including multi-factor authentication, access key rotation, encryption using KMS and TLS, Firewalls, Security Groups, and NACLs, S3 bucket policies. The reason being the client's data security is of great importance.

Design & architect self-healing, secured, HA & fault tolerant infrastructure in AWS making use of AWS services like ASG, Elastic Load balancers (NLB and ALB).
Used ASG to scale horizontally and vertically based on ingress traffic and CPU utilization, to save on company resources and cost.
Monitored servers, devices, and applications to identify and rectify potential issues on time.
Made use of CloudWatch and data dog for intensive monitoring of instances and resources.
Architect Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ for automatic failover servers and created roles for EC2, RDS, S3, and Cloud Watch resources to communicate with each other using IAM.
Made use of SSM for automating patching of AMIs by using patch manager.
Experience in migrating and implementing multiple applications from on-premises to cloud using AWS services, SMS, DBMS, Cloud Formation, S3, Route 53, Glacier, EC2, AURORA, SNS, Lambda, VPC, Cloud Trail, API gateway
Also made use of Content Delivery Service (CloudFront and AWS Global accelerator) to cache company data so that our users from different AWS regions can access data at quicker rates due to low latency.
Implemented maintenance and configuration of users account for Dev, QA and production servers and created roles for EC2, RDS, S3, and cloud watch resources to communicate with each other using IAM.
Perform continuous in-depth monitoring of cloud applications (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, VPC Flow logs, Config, etc.) and provide recommendations for minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating exploited or exploitable weaknesses, and minimizing impact to service/returning to normal service as quickly as possible.

Cloud Solutions Engineer (Perficient) August 2018 – Jan. 2021

Build and configure a virtual data center in the AWS Cloud to support Enterprise Data Warehouse hosting including Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Public and Private Subnets, Security Groups (SG), Route Tables, Elastic Load Balancers ELB), Route 53.
Deployed cloudwatch unified agents on instances for monitoring system metrics and application metrics and logs.
Advised and implemented the hosting of company applications within the Private Subnet and access to those applications were done with the help of bastion host.
Handled disaster recovery scenarios for backing up data and utilizing AWS backup and restore tools like AWS storage gateway and developed solutions around pilot light and warm standby.
Build servers using AWS, importing volumes, launching EC2, RDS, creating SG, auto-scaling, ELBs in the defined VPC.
Established VPC connectivity by making use of Transit Gateway for connecting VPCs and VPN connection to a datacenter.
Automate Compliance Governance by provisioning and leveraging AWS Landing Zone as well as AWS Control Tower for centralized enterprise architecture and also centralized managing.
Recommended AWS SSO on Control Tower for managing user access on multiple platforms.
Using CloudWatch, and VPC Flow Logs to monitor and retain account activity related to actions across AWS infrastructure.
Supported our CI/CD pipeline running on ECS with the use of terraform.
Created Task definitions, Task and services for these resources.
Deployed and managed EKS clusters with the use of terraform. Created cluster resources like pods, ingress controllers etc.
Used Jenkins to set up a continuous integration process for automation of our daily process.
Used Groovy for setting up pipeline jobs for different processes for test, build and code coverage with different plugins.
Set up and manage Docker containers running Go and PHP applications for deployment into Kubernetes pods.
Proposed and developed solutions for application deployments by making use of AWS code pipelines as compared to native tools for cost management.
