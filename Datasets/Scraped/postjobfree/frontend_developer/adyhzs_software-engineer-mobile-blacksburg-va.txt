Education
Virginia Tech (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) Blacksburg, VA Master of Engineering in Computer Science Aug 2022 - May 2024 Experience
Software Developer VIRGINIA TECH Feb 2023 – Present VA, USA
• Developing VT Security Standards website for IT Security Lab of Virginia Tech, which is aimed to provide comprehensive details about the security standards. Developed the front-end using React, back-end using Go and PostgreSQL as the database.
• Developed a website for the IT Security Lab of Virginia Tech, serving as a central platform for sharing information and updates related to the IT Security Department. Developed the website using Hugo ensuring efficient and high-performance web pages.
Senior Software Engineer Samsung R&D Institute Feb 2022 – Jul 2022 Bangalore, India
• Added a new feature to parse multiple crypto frames in a single TCP packet of a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) flow that reduces latency and congestion.
• Lead the development of the project “Integration of Machine Learning framework into DPI” and mentored an intern designated for the project. Created the project requirements, designed the architecture, assigned tasks and took the project to completion.
• Managed task assignment and fostered team collaboration using JIRA for streamlined project execution. Software Engineer Samsung R&D Institute Jan 2021 – Feb 2022 Bangalore, India
• Worked in the Deep Packet Inspection(DPI) team which mainly focuses on detecting applications at packet level in a network using regex pattern matching, port analysis and behavior analysis.
• Optimized the performance of DPI Engine by sending less number of bytes for detection and received the Spot award for improving the operation time by 100%.
• Automated the local test environment to perform regression testing using Python scripts. This improved the operation time by 83%.
• Improved the robustness of DPI solution by writing unit test cases using Gtest framework to increase the code coverage from 40% to 90% .
• Used SonarQube and Jenkins as integral parts of the development workflow, ensuring code sanity through inte- gration testing and continuous code quality monitoring. Research Assistant National Institute of Technology, Delhi May 2019 – Jul 2019 Delhi, India
• Worked on a project titled Handwritten Character Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks. This uses Neural Networks for recognition and Adam optimizer to reduce the loss function, which helps in faster compu- tation and require fewer parameter for tuning.
Projects
VT Security Standards IT Security Lab, Virginia Tech
• Developing the front-end of the project using React, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
• Developed APIs using Go programming language in Postman that is responsible for the communication between the front-end and the PostgreSQL database.
• Used GitLab for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of the code, and Slack as the primary communication tool with teammates, fostering effective collaboration and timely updates. QUIC Feature Addition Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore
• Designed and implemented a feature that enabled parsing of multiple crypto frames within a single TCP packet in a QUIC flow. Integrated the feature seamlessly into the existing QUIC protocol implementation.
• Defined unit test cases using Gtest framework to ensure the reliability and stability of the feature under various scenarios.
• Expertise in network protocols and programming languages like C++ were used to design and implement the feature.
• Successfully met project deadlines while efficiently delivering the implemented feature. The Book Garden W Virginia Tech
• An online bookstore web application developed using the Vue.js framework, Tomcat server, and Java as the back-end would provide users with a convenient way to browse, search, and purchase books online.
• Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, Typescript, Rest API, Java, Tomcat, MySQL Fancy Gallery W Virginia Tech
• Fancy Gallery is an android application that follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture and contains two primary fragments: Gallery and Map.
• Database operations, such as data storage and retrieval, are handled using the Room database.
• Used Moshi for handling the JSON data received from the API.
• Tech Stack: Kotlin, Room, Retrofit, Moshi, Android Studio Achievements and Awards
• Spot Award for the best performance in the month of October 2020 - Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore.
• Optimization of DPI Engine improved the operation time by 100%. - Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore.
• Automation of Local test environment for regression testing improved the operation time by 83%. - Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore.
• Improved the code coverage from 40% to 90%. - Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore.
• Second Runner-up at the American Express Makeathon 2019.
