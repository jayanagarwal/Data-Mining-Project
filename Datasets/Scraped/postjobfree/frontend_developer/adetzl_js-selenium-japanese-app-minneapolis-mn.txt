Full Stack Software Development Student
Individual Project: Pirate Storytime, a web application that allows you to store and search for story ideas to tell young children.
• I enjoy making up and telling pirate stories on the spot for my nephew and niece. However, when I’m tired it can be hard to do without prompt. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a site that would give me a few pirate story ideas on which to base my story? Pirate Storytime allows you to store your story ideas and share them with others.
• With Pirate Storytime, users can add their story ideas in five categories of story elements. They can choose to make these public or keep them private. They can also search through the public cards and add them to their favorites. When you’re ready to tell your story, one card of each type is randomly selected from your favorites.
• Technology used: MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js, Javascript, Angular Material and Filestack.

Group Project: Belwin Outdoor Science
• Belwin Outdoor Science is a nature conservancy where elementary school students conduct wildlife research. The teachers at Belwin used to distribute data sheets for students to fill out during their research. This makes it difficult to process the class data for the day. They do not save student research because it would be too much work to enter the data from the 10,000 students that visit each year.
• My development team and I built a mobile web app that allows students to enter their data on a mobile device and save it. After collecting research, teachers can easily generate reports that allow them to examine data as a class. Research is automatically saved in the database, so valuable student research is not lost.
• Technology used: PostgreSQL, Express, AngularJS, Node.js, Javascript, Angular Material, Passport.
