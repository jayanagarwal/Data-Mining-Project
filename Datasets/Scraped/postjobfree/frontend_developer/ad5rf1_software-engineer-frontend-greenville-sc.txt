Professional Experience:
Work at a multinational company with operations across the United States, Germany, Poland, France, and the United Kingdom. My primary role involved developing security web applications and services for American banks and Capgemini's digital department.

- Collaboration with Design Teams: Worked closely with designers to implement responsive designs, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience across various devices. This collaboration was crucial in maintaining design integrity and usability.
- UI Development from Designs: Translated design layouts from tools like Figma and Photoshop into fully functional application pages. This process involved detailed conversion of visual concepts into coded reality, maintaining fidelity to original design specifications.
- Storybook Implementation: Established a Storybook for the development team, which streamlined component development and testing. This tool significantly improved our development process by providing a sandbox to build and test UI components in isolation.
- Testing and Quality Assurance: Wrote and maintained unit tests for components, ensuring robustness and reliability. Additionally, I was actively involved in testing components to uphold the highest standards of quality. 2008-05
