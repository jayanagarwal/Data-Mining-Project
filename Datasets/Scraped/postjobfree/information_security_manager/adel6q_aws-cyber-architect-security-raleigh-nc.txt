A proven thought leader, cross-organizational trusted adviser, team builder, and technologist, looking to leverage my business and technical experience and skills to achieve the most challenging goals. Seeking a new opportunity that focuses on managing and mitigating risks associated with the governance and compliance of information/cyber security, continuity, and data privacy, where I can drive corporate-wide improvements to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of informational assets.

Held various IT roles (Executive Leadership Team Member, Enterprise/Domain/IT Architect, Team Lead, Program/Project Manager, and Technology Subject Manager Expert) with over 25+ years of expanding experience/expertise across business processes, data center solutions, IT services, applications, and infrastructure to ensure processes and technology support business function compliance to regulatory/contractual obligations and business objectives. Lead/facilitated global cross-functional teams and large-scale assignments that represent significant cultural, functional, process, and technical impacts across all levels of a company. Achieving change by ensuring all participants (executives, sponsors, subject matter experts, etc.) align to a common vision, strategy, and execution that properly balance risks and business value.

A strategic/tactical individual contributor that uses logic and reason to break down complex systems and ideas, find obscure connections between seemingly disparate phenomena, create simple concepts to explain why things are as they are, and then develop solutions and plans to resolve and/or improve current state. Leveraging strong communication and influencing skills, move through all phases: visions, strategies, roadmaps, requirements, implementations and then mentoring/training staff to fully operationalize the technology/process.

As such, the best way to depict those activities is through my established reputation with those that assigned me to the activities.
