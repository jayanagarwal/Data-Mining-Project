Dear Hiring Manager,
I would like to share with you my resume and express my strong interest in this position. I am a motivated self-starter with extensive experience in leading large transformational change programs, building teams, and department leadership. Having been a senior management consultant for the past several years, I have had the opportunity to build a diverse skillset across multiple disciplines. I am seeking to transition my career to full-time status where I can share the experiences and skills that I have developed in my years as a management consultant into a long-term relationship with your organization.
In my most recent position, I led a team of over 40 IT service professionals at Tower Health to create and deliver an enterprise technology service model for an organization with over 200 locations, based on data, a clearly defined structure, and a strong focus on customer service and fostering IT / Business relationships. In my previous positions, I established policies, developed strategies, and led the successful implementation of several complex organizational change initiatives across all facets of organizations. I have proven expertise from both the tactical and strategy perspectives, implementing governance and controls while establishing trusted relationships in every situation.
I am looking forward to meeting with you to discuss my qualifications and the value that I will prove with your organization.
Warm Regards,
Andrew Hallac
