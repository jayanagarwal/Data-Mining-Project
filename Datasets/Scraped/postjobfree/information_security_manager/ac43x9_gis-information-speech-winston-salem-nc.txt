PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Time Warner / Charter / Spectrum January 2018 – March 2018
Consultant, Merger & Acquisitions Consulting Analytics

Performed post-merger migration analysis, planning and evaluation to fully migrate the merged
companies into one enterprise from the three separate company domains in place. This
includes, customer care centers, billing systems, data / telephony infrastructure and many systems

Bright House Networks, the level of effort to seamlessly combine the merged companies into one
enterprise has taken longer than the executive management team now in place expected.

My role was to perform a complete assessment of the existing technologies, develop a
plan and recommendations in order that the companies can migrate all systems and technologies
into one Charter Communications enterprise platform.
