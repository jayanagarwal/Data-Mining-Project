RESEARCH PROJECTS

Object/Face Recognition in Varying Illumination Conditions
Designed a novel interpolation based supervised learning algorithm to model lighting variation in images. The
model allows for both synthesis and analysis of images in different illumination conditions such as lighting
intensity and/or lighting position
Devised and successfully implemented an image recognition framework over the interpolation algorithm to
consider varying illumination conditions
Designed and captured an image dataset with varying lighting intensity to demonstrate and publish experimental
results
Evaluated the novel recognition method with our image dataset and the Yale extended face database for varying
lighting position and showed extremely competitive results in terms of recognition rate

Image Based Rendering and Lighting
Designed a novel Image Based Rendering and Lighting algorithm using a synthesis-analysis technique along
with a novel interpolation based supervised learning algorithm
The Image Based Rendering and Lighting algorithm can render nonexistent objects in unknown environments
as long as the object models are learnt using the interpolation based learning algorithm
The same algorithm is also capable of inferring the lighting parameters of unknown environments provided an
object whose interpolation model is already learnt exists in the scene
Motion Retargeting and Analysis
A novel interpolation based supervised learning algorithm is used to mathematically model animated motion
using a set of motion capture data as training data
The model represents a particular action for a set of all possible (topologically identical) skeletons/characters
defined within a parametric space
With this model for a particular trained motion sequence the same motion sequence is retargeted into a new
character with different skeletal parameters
The inverse computation of this interpolation model is used to recognize the skeleton’s identity given its motion
sequence

Topological Gabor Descriptor
Designed and constructed an image descriptor invariant to scale, rotation about the Z axis and uniform lighting
variations
The filter bank is built using a novel arrangement of 2D Gabor filters. The topology of the filter bank allows for
a simple 1D circular shift in the descriptor space to search for matches that are rotationally invariant. The
descriptor is essentially like a time series comprising of the responses of the filters in the filter bank. Image
matching or recognition is achieved by performing a circular shift in the descriptor space while computing and
minimizing a suitable distance metric
The descriptors are computed for a spatial location in a dense pyramid of images to achieve scale invariance.
The rotational invariance is robust to a complete 360 degree rotation in the z-axis

Estimating Recombination Variability among Mouse Strains
Developed scripts to extract large amounts of genetic data from web pages and compiled them into data-sets
Constructed genetic-maps for each data-set utilizing QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) mapping tools using Hidden
Markov Models (HMM)
Statistically analyzed the resulting genetic-maps to study the genetic control over the rate of meiotic
recombination in mice

RELEVANT ACADEMIC PROJECTS

AdaBoost Based Face Recognition System
Implemented an AdaBoost based face detection system using Haar-like features (Rectangle filters) as weak
classifiers on integral-images
Implemented a face recognition system using ADABoost and one-vs-all classifiers

A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Based Face Recognition System
Implemented a face recognition algorithm using Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant
Analysis and tested with the ORL face database

Stacking Blocks using RHINO Robot Arm
A robot system consisting of a 6 degree of freedom robot arm and a camera was programmed to pick up blocks
off the table and build a particular set of two stacks from them (without knocking off any stacks). The
implementation was divided into the following subtasks,
Performed image processing to compute the pixel coordinates of the object
Converted pixel coordinates into world coordinates
Performed inverse kinematics and picking and stacking of blocks in the stacking area

Navigating a Known Obstacle Course with a Lego Robot
Designed and built a holonomic robot to navigate through an obstacle course (obstacles, start and goal locations
are selected arbitrarily)
Implemented a navigation strategy using Manhattan distances to generate all possible paths from Start to Goal
The robot iteratively computes the values for each neighboring cells and uses a greedy approach to reach the
goal with minimum collisions
Behavior-based Fire Alarm Robot
Designed and built a behavior-based fire detection robot that is able to move from an unknown position in an
indoor environment to look for a fire and raise an alarm
A set of three behaviors, including "wander" (search), "wall following" and "fire detection"(and raise alarm)
were implemented
These behaviors were integrated using the subsumption architecture

DATASETS AND TOOLS

CVPoV: An Automated Tool for Generating Synthetic Ground Truth Images
CVPoV is a computational tool built over a popular ray-tracer POVRay that allows the user to specifically
generate images/videos of simple objects or complex scenes involving several different objects.
The tool saves depth information and camera parameters which are then used to compute point correspondence,
motion field data, and occlusion maps.
This tool is designed to allow the user to automatically generate synthetic ground-truth data for several
computer vision problems such as camera calibration, feature matching, 3D reconstruction and object
recognition

Image Dataset with Varying Lighting Intensity
Designed and built an image capture setup with 16 identical cameras (Point Grey Flea3) and a static scene under
81 different illumination conditions
Four identical lamps with three intensity levels each were used to create the 81 different lighting configurations

Image Dataset with Varying Geometric Pose
Designed and captured images of several individual objects with 360 rotation about the vertical axis and
translation in x and y axes with a black background
