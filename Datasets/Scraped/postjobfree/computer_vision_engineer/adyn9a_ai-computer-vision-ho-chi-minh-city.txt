Hao Phuong Coporation - Shrimp counter system (10/2022 – 05/2023) Description: A system that can count and extract the size of shrimp seed at speed 12.000 shrimp/minute with 94% accuracy.
• YOLOv6S int8-tensorrt quantizated model for object detection.
• SORT tracking to calibrate the average speed of the water flow.
• Run real-time on Jetson Nano.
• Connect to Hikrobot industrial camera.
Personal Project –Anomaly Detection in Relay Module (04/2023 -06/2023) Description: A simple system with a graphic user interface that can classify good and not good relays and locate where the errors are with the accuracy can reach to 90% at image level and 87% at pixel level.
• This is an unsupervised learning, to train the model, we just only need the good samples.
• Padim RestNet18 model to extract features and classify images.
• Connect to Hikrobot industrial camera.
• Communicate with PLC S7-1200 Simens to control the actuator. Engineering thesis - Blister Inspection (10/2019 - 04/2020) Description: Develop the program that can capture images of blisters on conveyor, inspect these blisters into two groups: standard and non-standard. Then the program will send the signal to PLC to control the pneumatic cylinder push non-standard blisters out of the conveyor.
● C++ and MFC interface.
● Fourier transform to extract features from the contours.
● SVM to classify contours from features.
● The program can run real time at the conveyor’s speed < 2m/s.
● The accuracy of the inspection can reach 86%.
