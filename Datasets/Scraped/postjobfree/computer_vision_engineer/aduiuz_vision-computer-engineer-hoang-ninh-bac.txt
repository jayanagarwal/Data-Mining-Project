Title:Profesional III
Job description: Automation Engineer
Working Experiences:
- Programming PC control with Motion control, Vision application, Barcode foolproof use APIs of GMES.Some high light project:
Sorting bracket project:(C++Programming) Applied OpenCV APIs to Vision inspection mold ID to sorting bracket on the QT IDE. Project reduce 2 Operator/line x 12 line x 2 Shift.
Vision Inspector machine: (C# Programming) Applied the APIs of Cognex vision to Inspection product of Network Packing line, in this machine use RES APIs GMES, Serial number of product will sent to GMES and receive result model information and then result of inspection will save in GMES database. 3
Use IDE C# I completed project with GMES interface module and motion control. Project remove Operator manual inspection.
Predict eye Screw machine: (C# Programming) Applied OPC UA server and SQL to get data screw machine(Point screw, Torque, Speed). After receive data, Program will show ressult screw for PQC processing of production line. This is project will base of machine learning for next project and Reduce manual inspection time.
Foolproof Packing: (C# Programming) Applied APIs of GMES and synchronized data of each process packing with accessory item code. This is project foolproof loss of Operation packing and back up Packing data.
Inspection function tesst Auto line: (C# Programming) Applied APIs of GMES with PLC Siemens to interface, system will get result test of product and sent to GMES automatic.
Auto Barcode reader: (C# Programming) Applied APIs MX compoinent of Mitsubishi PLC to interface and Smart barcode reader. After read barcode, data will sent to PLC and GMES.
- Developer IoT project for Predict eye(Energy, Assembly data, Environment) use OPC UA server, SQL, Raspery PI
SMD line predict Energy system: (Python Programming) Applied Raspery PI to receive signal from sensing installed in SMD machine, Data analysis and show information about current electric, Speed, Temperature of reflow machine. This system will monitoring and warning realtime.
Enviroment Predict eye monitoring: (Python Programming) Applied Raspery PI get Data from sensing in factory. AGV will bring sensing and auto check all station need check environment, Data will sent to Raspery module client. This system will monitoring data and warning in display.
- Programming PLC(Mitsubishi, Siemens, Panasonic, LS), Robot industrial(Kawasaki, Kuka, Fanuc), HMI…
Polishing auto: Use Kawasaki robot, Auto offset polishing position follow level of the grinding.
Auto glass mixing chemical: Use Fanuc robot pick up glass magazine mix to chemical bathtub and place to unloading module.
Auto Load/Unload CNC line: Use Kuka robot pick up product in Tray, input to Jig vaccumm of CNC machine and unloading.
