A quick hands-on learner in administrative support settings, I adapt easily to the needs of employers. Through placement in contract I.T. jobs via technology staffing firms my focus recently has been on customer support in help desk team settings. Here I’ve had the opportunity to master business software tools aimed at customer support. Now I seek a permanent customer-facing position. I excel in finding solutions for colleagues and others in a welcoming environment by using all my skills to build organizational efficiency and satisfaction of those I serve.
