Objective
My Objectives are to learn a new skill if needed. I thrive on learning and working with others. I guess that is why I was able to work in a call center for 18yrs and now I am wanting a new challenge in my life and wanting a new change of environment.

Ability Summary
I am a great Team Player. I thrive on resolving issues on a first call basis when possible. I try to listen to the issues at hand and start to plan a way of resolving the issue with little to no downtime to the customer or to the team.
