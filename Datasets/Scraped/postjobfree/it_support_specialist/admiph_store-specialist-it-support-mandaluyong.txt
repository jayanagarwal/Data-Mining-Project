WORK EXPERIENCE
Promo Edge Corp
Store Specialist
Chino Roces Ave, Makati City
August 5, 2019 – Present
• Complete Retail Sales - The retail specialist’s primary duty is to help customers buy items. This can include helping the customer find a product, placing a special order for out-of-stock or specialty items, and providing information about products. The retail specialist also processes payments and accepts cash, which frequently involves making change, applying coupons or promotions, and bagging the customer’s items after the sale.
• Respond to Customer Questions - In many cases, the retail specialist answers customer questions about products, stock availability, promotions, and store policies. A customer may want to know about the shop’s return and exchange policies, for example, or ask whether a promotion applies to a specific item. This part of the job requires a high level of familiarity with the store’s offerings, policies, and events.
• Arrange Displays - Retail specialists ensure that stores look their best and that customers can reach items by arranging displays and merchandizing items. This can include arranging seasonal and holiday displays, placing sale items in a central location for customers to browse, and front-facing items such as books to create a visually and aesthetically pleasing shopping experience. Retail specialists also make sure that items are correctly priced before they are added to shelves.
• Maintain Stock and Inventory Records - Retail specialists maintain stock and inventory records while restocking items and completing sales. The retail specialist may visually review inventory levels or complete a periodic inspection, comparing current inventory levels to internal records. The retail specialist then takes note of any discrepancies or missing stock. In many cases, a retail specialist may submit a list of low-stock items to a buyer to ensure that the store always has sufficient product on hand.
• Process Returns and Exchanges - Retail specialists process returns and exchanges according to store policy. In this aspect of the job, they may check a customer’s receipt to determine whether their item is eligible for a refund or exchange and may offer the refund in the form of store credit if the customer is returning an item after a certain amount of time has passed. The retail specialist records these returns and exchanges and removes damaged items from inventory.
• Upsell Value-Added Items - Retail specialists support store profitability by upselling high-margin or value-added items to customers. These items can include insurance or protection plans for consumer electronics or devices, or
“impulse buy” items placed near the counter, such as snacks and drinks. SK Kagawad (Sanggunian Kagawad)
