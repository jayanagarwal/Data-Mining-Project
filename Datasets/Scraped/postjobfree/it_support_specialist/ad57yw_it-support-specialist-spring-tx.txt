As a Google Certified IT Support Specialist, I have a passion for IT excellence and a strong background in IT support, operations, and management. I'm proficient in networking, binary, customer support, troubleshooting, and more.

I recently worked as an IT Support Specialist at Kroger, where I provided exceptional support to users, optimized network
infrastructure, and ensured cybersecurity. I effectively diagnosed and addressed common problems related to computers, peripherals, applications, and network connectivity. I also collaborated

I also have retail experience as a Center Store Clerk and a Bagger, where I developed my customer service and attention to detail skills.

I hold a high school diploma from Klein Oak High School and three Google certifications in Technical Support Fundamentals,
Computer Networking, and Operating Systems. I'm eager to leverage my technical acumen, problem-solving skills, and passion for IT to contribute to your organization's success. I value learning, collaboration, and innovation, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.
