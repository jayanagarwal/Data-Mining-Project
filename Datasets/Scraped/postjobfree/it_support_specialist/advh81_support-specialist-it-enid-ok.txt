DIRECTOR OF MUSIC &
PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES
Being a technology director over the last decade has made me fluent in management, budgeting, and
technology. Over the years, I have learned to plan ahead effectively, but be flexible when needed. The experience I have obtained from my positions has led me to be a continual learner allowing me to become an expert in many areas. Being a team leader is just as important as being a team member!
