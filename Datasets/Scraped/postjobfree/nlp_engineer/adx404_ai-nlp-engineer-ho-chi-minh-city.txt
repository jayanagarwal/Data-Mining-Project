AI ENGINEER
OBJECTIVE
Take advantages of Machine Learning, Data Analysis with Python skills and understanding of Data - AI technologies to become a Data Scientist, Data Analysis Intern. Try to master the job within 2 months and the long-term goal is to become a Data Sciene Engineer in the future.
WORK EXPERIENCE
MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER INTERN // June 2022 - Sep 2022 DATA & AI department of the Institute for Research and Innovation in Computer Science (IRICS) - STECH Technology & Engineering JSC Project: Paperless Meeting (Speech to Text)
Position: Separate Silence, Speaker Diarization, Config Google API Content: I transcribe Audio with Split Function associated with Google Cloud Speech-To API. To trim long audio, if its durations are longer than 1 minutes, then the processing will faster. For audio longer than 1 minutes, you need to send it to Google Cloud, it may take longer time for long audio. After Audio split speakers with Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm, audio is processed with silences time no longer than 500 ms & accurately convert speech into text with an API via Google Cloud. Achievements and skills gained:
- The Vietnam People’s Army uses this program for both offline and online conferences, which uses artificial intelligence technology and comprehensive security.
- Improve my Data Sciene Skill.
- Improve English Communication Skill.
