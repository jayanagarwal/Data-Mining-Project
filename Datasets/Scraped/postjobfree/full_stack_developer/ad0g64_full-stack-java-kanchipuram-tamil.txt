JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with the DB. Hibernate removes a lot of boiler-plate code that comes with JDBC API, the code looks more cleaner and readable. RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data (get) and delete data.
Full stack project development is the process of creating a web application's front end (client-side) and back end (server-side). Title: Library Management System
