expertise
I am a senior full stack .net software developer, process automation engineer, solution architect and a techno-functional expert with over nine years of hands-on experience providing solutions to business problems.
My centralized account management API used across all banking channels and branches is helping Jaiz Bank to achieve its financial-inclusion goal. I solely built the corporate online- payment solution, fleet management solution, Hajj savings and planning solution and USSD portal, among others for Jaiz Bank.

I have done numerous software developments and system integrations via REST and SOAP API.
