Intro I'm a full-stack developer with over 17 years of professional experience. Programming is inherently complex, and I find nothing more interesting than the challenge of creating systems that are, as much as possible, simple, coherent and maintainable. It's been said that the mark of a great developer is their ability to tame complexity. I fully subscribe to this notion and it drives the languages and software I prefer to use: Lisp, Redis, Vim and Arch Linux to name a few.
