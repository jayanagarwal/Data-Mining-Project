• Spearheaded the initiative-taking identification and resolution of critical issues within communication and networking XBee RF modules for IoT devices, significantly impacting and enhancing the success of 3 concurrent projects.
• Conducted in-depth analysis of pertinent research papers, and actively experimented with diverse solutions, methodologies, and algorithms to troubleshoot technical problems and execute tasks effectively. Python Developer at IBM (Pheme Software Private Limited), India May 2021 – June 2021
• Created a meticulous inventory management system using Django Framework that allowed companies to handle staff information and asset/product details, which helped boost productivity by 50% and saved more than $55,000 annually.
• Developed a user-friendly scalable web application, capturing an impressive 80% user base and streamlined data management through relational databases at the back end while fortifying security against attacks like cross-site scripting and SQL injection.
• Led a proactive team of 3 in the end-to-end development, utilizing Git and Trello for collaboration and version control ensuring efficient implementation of functionalities, while overseeing well-written documentation and reporting to project manager.
• Led cross-functional partnership over Slack to transform the system's front-end for better usability and optimization, achieving an exceptional 5-fold surge in user satisfaction and adoption rates. PROJECTS
Weather Predictor
• Pioneered an innovative approach for time-series prediction of weather features utilizing the PySpark framework on a distributed system and leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.
• Directed seamless end-to-end processes encompassing data loading, preprocessing, model instantiation, training, testing, and result visualization. Achieved an outstanding R2 score of 0.885, highlighting the model's exceptional predictive accuracy. Keep-N-Eye: COVID Prevention System
• Engineered a deep learning enabled COVID preventive support system employing the YOLO algorithm with a remarkable 92% accuracy to facilitate monitoring masking and social distancing.
• The result was a high-performance system that reduced the chances of accidental contact or violation of guidelines by 30%. Attendance Capturing System
• Standardized the MTCNN face detection algorithm and OpenCV for camera control to establish a robust system that captures and converts images into RGB arrays, subsequently employing an SVM classifier showing 93% accuracy for precise face recognition.
• Revolutionized attendance reporting by skillfully integrating Flask into a web platform, achieving a remarkable 40% decrease in manual data entry and empowering users with instantaneous access to real-time attendance records. SecuroServe: Secure Chat App
• Created a real-time, cost-effective messaging web application using MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Nodejs to deliver a secure platform for LAN-based communication essential for organizations with unreliable internet connection and no critical chat history.
• Significantly reduced security risks, including data leaks, theft, and privacy breaches, by up to 80% through local data control and eliminating external dependencies.
