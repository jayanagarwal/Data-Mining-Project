Dear Hiring Manager,
My appreciation for what America stands for is what brought me to serve 20 years in the United States Marine Corps and through my time serving, I have developed and acquired a vast array of skill sets that I am sure to bring value to your company. During my time serving, I have also taken the opportunity to get certified in Full-Stack Development, which I eagerly continue to educate myself in. During my time in the Marines, I served in two main capacities, Food Service Operations and Recruiting. While in those fields, I have grown a deep respect for accomplishing difficult tasks, working under extreme conditions and constraints, training and mentoring those who work for me and the importance of interpersonal relationships. I have incorporated these skills into the developing and programming communities as a means to help and assist those around me to be better which in turn makes our projects and myself overall immensely better. I humble myself in this community as it is always keeping me on my toes as I am constantly learning this demanding field, however I do with fervor.
I would greatly appreciate your review of my enclosed resume and outlined credentials. I am excited about the changes in the tech industry and always enjoy mastering my craft in any capacity. Being people helping people is always a trend I can get behind and the shared relationships that are involved are welcome. At your earliest convenience, please feel free to contact me and set up a meeting. Learning starts on, ‘ hello’.
Sincerely,
Anthony Cole
