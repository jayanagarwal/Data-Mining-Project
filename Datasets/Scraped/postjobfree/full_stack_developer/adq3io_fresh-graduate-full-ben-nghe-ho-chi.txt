Thank you for the opportunity to apply for this position at your company. After reviewing your job description, it’s clear that you’re looking for a candidate that is extremely familiar with the responsibilities associated with the role and can perform them confidently. Given these requirements, I am certain that I have the necessary skills to successfully do the job adeptly and perform above expectations. I am a hard-working software engineering student currently attending the last year of RMIT University. During my academic career, I also managed to accrue nearly 6 months of work experience. I had the privilege of working for Schaeffler in a software engineer role as my graduation project, where I learned valuable professional skills such as database development, website architecture, android development course, and robot automation. Although my background is more from programming, I also have some projects about data analytics to increase patient’s length of stay and my proud project about discovering the modern movie dataset (these are listed in my CVs). In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised as adaptable by my professors and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven communication, creative thinking, and analytical skills, which I hope to leverage into the Developer at your company. After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I am the type of competent and competitive candidate you are looking for.
