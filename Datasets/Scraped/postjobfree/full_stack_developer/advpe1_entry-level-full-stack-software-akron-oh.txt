I am A US Navy Veteran and dedicated family man. I love technology in its entirety. Since 2009, when I joined the Navy, I have worked as an electronics/electrical technician, and even before that I have always had a love of fixing everything from VCRs to computers. I found in the last few years a love for creating programs, with my start being a spreadsheet for managing a maintenance department that I developed myself in Excel. I look forward to learning new things everyday and finding new knots to unravel.
