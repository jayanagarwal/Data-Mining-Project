I built a new solution architecture for migrating legacy public transportation systems in São Paulo, with a focus on digital ticketing and ancillary systems. I proposed a solution to accommodate an estimated volume of 20 million daily users, developing a distributed microservices system using Golang, Java Spring, Node.js, React, and Nginx. Additionally, I created microservices and an API gateway capable of handling high volumes of concurrent and secure transactions, leveraging JWT and OAuth2, this system were integrations with the metro and trains of São Paulo. I configured servers using Docker and Kubernetes for all systems in a Linux environment.
I took on the leadership role of a team dedicated to support, development, and security, addressing both legacy and new architecture. I was also responsible for developing a facial recognition API for monitoring, interaction, and integration with biometrics. For the front-end, I utilized React and Redux with micro frontend, while for the back-end, I utilized more than one technology for compose microservices.
