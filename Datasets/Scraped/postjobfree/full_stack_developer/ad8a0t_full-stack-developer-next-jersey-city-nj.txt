Wrote reusable, testable and efficient code using Core PHP, Bootstrap. Regal Academy - Teaching Experience of 4 months (Sept 23 - Jan 24) Gujarat, India Instructed courses on Data Structures, Database Management Systems, Java, Object-Oriented Programming in Java, Core PHP, Laravel, React, Git, Docker, and other technologies, facilitating a comprehensive learning experience for more than 50 students PROJECTS:
MyHomeHunt.com (Currently working)
Technologies used: Nextjs, Docker, Postgresql, GraphQL, Postgaphile, Mantine UI library Developed a highly efficient web-based real estate application above mentioned technologies. Focused on delivering a user-friendly platform for finding and managing properties.
Property Search and Selection: Implemented functionalities allowing users to browse and select properties for rent, purchase, or sale, enhancing the user experience with an intuitive and effective search system.
Broker Interface: Designed a unique feature for brokers to view property availability and pricing information on a map. This functionality enables brokers to easily identify vacant homes and coordinate with landlords, streamlining the property selection process for their clients. Virtual Tours and Communication: Enabled users to take virtual tours of properties after communicating with owners through the portal. All communication between users and property owners is conducted within the website, ensuring a seamless and secure interaction. Github: https://github.com/Fenilkadhiwala/MyHomeHunt MedAssist:
Technologies used: React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, JWT, Docker, Redis, GraphQL, BullMQ Developed an Inventory Management web app utilizing React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT Authentication. Enhanced functionality and efficiency for medical shopkeepers. I interviewed several medical shop owners to understand the problems they face in their daily operations before starting the project. Comprehensive Inventory Management: Enabled medical shopkeepers to efficiently manage their inventory by adding, removing, and updating bulk stocks. Implemented features to generate invoices, send notifications to customers, view product history, and create purchase orders, streamlining daily operations and improving user experience.
Automated Expiry Management: Integrated Redis and BullMQ to automate the removal of expired products from the database. Designed a system where expired product data is calculated and scheduled as a job in BullMQ, even if the website is inactive. The system computes the difference between the expiration date and the current time, scheduling the job to delete expired products when the time reaches zero. The job execution not only removes the expired products from the database but also notifies the shopkeeper, significantly reducing manual workload and maintaining inventory accuracy. Impact: Achieved a 50% reduction in workload for chemists by automating product expiry management, ensuring a more efficient and reliable inventory system.
