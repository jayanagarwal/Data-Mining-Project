Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my interest in the position of Java Developer at Amtex Systems Inc. I graduated from Northwest Missouri University with a degree in Computer Science in December 2020. During my time as an undergraduate student, I was able to gain valuable experience through various projects. I worked on back-end and front-end projects such as Goodwill of Omaha mobile web app, Northwest parking ticket mobile app, Tic Tac Toe game, Calculator app and Calendar App using JAVA, Spring framework, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, Ruby, CSS, Framework, Bootstrap, Python, and Swift.
For the Goodwill app, I was the lead developer for the UI design where I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I used JavaScript to build donation pages where users could increment or decrement the number of donations. I directly worked with the back-end team to ensure that the app was functional and presentable to the client. I have also worked on an IOS mobile app project where I used XCode and Swift. The project enabled users to give out parking tickets just by taking a picture of the license plate number or entering the license plate number into the app. I assisted the lead developer with the back- end task which included modifying and documenting codes for the aforementioned project. I was also the lead developer for the login page, the UI view and the icon for this mobile app project. These projects required us to practice SCRUM and Agile Software Development methodologies. I have also developed Tic Tac Toe game, Calculator and Calendar apps using JAVA language. I used abstract, interface classes, loops, methods, inheritance, arrays, getter/setter and polymorphism in developing these projects.
I worked as a Residential Assistant (RA) at Northwest Missouri State University where I developed good communication, teamwork and leadership skills. I had to work under stressful situations where I was counted on to make quick decisions on a regular basis. While working on school projects that dealt with programming, I developed good working relationships with many team members to reach the desired goal. I am confident that my technical skills and prior work in back-end coding, cross-platform development, and front-end coding will make me an ideal candidate for this role. Although, I have all the necessary qualifications and skills required for this role, I am confident in my ability to learn any new programming language or tool in little time. I have also attached my resume, which further details my skills and educational background. Please do not hesitate to reach out, if you have any questions about my projects and background. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you further and I thank you in advance for your time and consideration. Sincerely,
Aarjap Piya
