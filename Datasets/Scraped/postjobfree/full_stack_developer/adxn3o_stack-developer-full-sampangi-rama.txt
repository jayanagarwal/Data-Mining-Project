PROJECTS
“Fabrication of Fuel Injector Cleaning and Testing Rig.” Method and apparatus for the determination of the fuel flow condition of a fuel injector is in its operative position in an engine are described. The device comprises of a liquid reservoir, a measuring chamber for the liquid and conduit to flow the liquid through the chamber to the injector to flow the liquid through the chamber to the injector under constant pressure as well as electric circuitry to open and close the injector for at least one pre-determined time interval. The chamber is refillable from reservoir to a pre-determined liquid level after each choose. The liquid can be passed through the injector in short repeated bursts or in more prolonged flows. Comparison of the volume of the liquid passing through the subject fuel injector in the given time period with volume of a like liquid pass through a reference fuel injector in the same time period is indicative of the fuel flow condition of the subject fuel injector. The invention is applicable to fuel injectors on many types of stationary and vehicular engines and is particularly applicable to the testing of automotive fuel injection system.
