EXPERIENCE
AI CHATBOT USING OPENAI
I have developed an AI chatbot specifically designed for website visitors. The chatbot is integrated into the HubSpot platform and utilizes a fine-tuned model based on OpenAI technology. This allows visitors to ask questions to the chatbot, and in response, the bot generates and provides answers based on its training data.
ONLINE SCRIPT EDITOR APP FOR FILM DIRECTORS
A Laravel-based web app with an online script editor. I developed the back-end and front-end application with user authentication, a subscription feature, and a 2Checkout payment gateway. I also created the online script editor by customizing the TinyMCE editor.
MOBILE HEALTH APP
Developed a mobile health app that connects a medical kit through Bluetooth. It measures health-related information such as temperature, pulse rate, and blood pressure, and securely stores it on the database. Users can obtain a quick diagnosis and a doctor's appointment.

A React native-based app for customer supports. I mainly worked on the front-end UI, bug fixes, and new features with another back-end developer. The app is integrated with the Twilio API for WhatsApp and provides multiple
