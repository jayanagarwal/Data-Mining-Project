Work Experience

Best Buy, Senior AWS Full stack Java Developer August 2020- Present
Minnesota

Project Description: I worked on an application that is part of online retail store that allowed customers to make purchases securely while reducing the purchase response time. Here I was working on Spring framework, and wrote several backend controllers to handle the routing in the application. I designed and developed this platform using microservices architecture and built robust APIs from scratch to handle user authentication and payment integration. Used Spring MVC and Java 8 for the application. Later deployed it on AWS Cloud Environment.

Lead the development of Microservices-based backend architecture for a Best buy platform, resulting in a 30% reduction in response time and a 20% increase in system scalability by low payment failures.
Collaborated with the front-end team to optimize API endpoints and reduce the number of network requests, leading to a more responsive and user-friendly web application.
Employed AWS services, including Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3, to build a serverless data processing pipeline, saving in infrastructure costs and improving data processing speed by 40%.
Designed and orchestrated complex workflows using AWS Step Functions, streamlining and automating data processing and integration across diverse AWS services.
Leveraged Spring Boot and Hibernate to refactor legacy monolithic applications into Microservices, enhancing code maintainability and promoting agile development practices.
Developed REST APIs using Spring boot, hosted all micro services on Pivotal Cloud Factory (PCF) and deployed it on AWS Cloud Environment.
Responsible for designing and developing Java components using Spring framework to implement transaction management. Also worked on deploying J2EE applications on Best Buy WebSphere Application.
Used Java 8 streams and lambda expressions to increase performance. Also worked on CI/CD pipeline for a deployment of project.

Target, AWS Java Developer July 2017- August 2020
Minnesota

Extensively used Core Java API, Spring Boot, Gradle, Kafka, Apache Camel in developing the components.
Leveraged Kafka API as well as Apache Camel in developing components. Also developed an application from scratch to extract virtual store information for a given store using RESTful API.
Integrated existing API's to AWS API management (AWS Lambda) to get all the attributes like security, usage plans, throttling, analytics, monitoring, and alerts.
Worked with Docker to deploy Microservices in modern containers to increase Isolation. Experience with building Docker Images and running them on Docker container.
Integrated Amazon Personalize and cloud front resulting a hike of about 25% in customer retention by giving them better recommendations.
Developed a consumer of digital receipts which persists these receipts into Postgres DB which holds 6 monthsâ€™ worth of data.
Utilized AWS S3 for storing and processing large volumes of unstructured and structured data, enabling advanced data analytics and data mining.
Created an automated ElasticSearch index creation scheduler which creates a new index for the next month in the elasticsearch database at the end of every month.
Collaborated with AWS support to resolve complex issues and implement advanced features within AWS Data Pipeline, enhancing overall pipeline performance and reliability.
Implemented an ACR mechanism that compares and ensures that the receipts getting ingested into the ElasticSearch, Cassandra databases are the same.
