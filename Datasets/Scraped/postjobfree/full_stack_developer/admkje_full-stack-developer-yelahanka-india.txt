Description : This project sets sight on authenticating the conventional E secure transaction system. In the prevailing system though the Credit card saves a convenient mode of transactions, it is subjected to more jeopardy. As technology extends its limit, the way of hacking and cracking also goes along the road. In out proposed system, in every transaction with the Credit card a handshaking signal is achieved with the cardholder. The handshaking method is achieved by transferring the transaction time and the purchase details to the mobile of the cardholder by means of a GSM modem. From the acknowledgement and authentication received from the cardholder’s mobile further transaction proceeds.
