Haven Technologies (MassMutual startup), New York NY Jan – August 2023 Full Stack Developer
• Worked within the policy administration side of the company’s insurtech product, collaborating on the development of new features, leveraging TypeScript and Angular to address both backend and frontend changes.
• Volunteered to join an urgent temporary team responsible for revitalizing the regression testing suite, repairing numerous broken test assertions, and integrating the suite into the GitLab CI/CD pipelines. This enhancement ensures detection of faulty code before merging changes into development, significantly reducing production bugs.
• Expanded the regression test coverage by incorporating additional test cases to validate newly introduced features using Mocha and Chai, thus enhancing the reliability and robustness of the software.
• Investigated and resolved production bugs as they surfaced, mending live production data with data migrations, and implementing complex business logic requirements to avoid future errors.
• Improved and introduced new API endpoints, providing more versatile data from the backend that could be used in custom frontend platforms, as part of the effort to build a SaaS friendly environment.
Haven Technologies (MassMutual startup), New York NY June – August 2022 Full Stack Developer Summer Intern

• Integrated a new design system into the existing codebase, updating both the Angular components and CSS classes to improve maintainability, consistency, and visual appeal of the UI.
• Implemented a new endpoint into the system, leveraging Ngrx to efficiently retrieve and store the data for the invoicing tab from the API response. BluEdge, New York NY October - November 2021
