Kier Construction Services Ltd (t/a Source Design Services Ltd), Elstree, Hertfordshire, UK Managed design office comprising up to 16 civil, electrical, and mechanical engineers, CAD technicians and document controllers.
Responsible for design office objectives with regards to turnover, profitability, quality, and effectiveness with the teams working harmoniously.
Ensured designs are well coordinated and meet client requirements. Performed Contractor’s Responsible Engineer (CRE) duties and assisted and acted for Head of Engineering in performance of Contractor’s Engineering Manager duties when required. Prepared tenders and fee proposals for work winning, and relationship building for future work. Allocated and scheduled resources for ongoing and anticipated projects in the office to ensure programmes were met and within the budget.
Specific Key Achievements:
• Identified deficiencies in general weekly staff meetings as a means for resource allocation and monitoring. I overhauled meeting format to only include senior engineers and senior CAD technicians, and directed agenda towards resourcing for upcoming deadlines, resolving conflicts in resource allocation and providing some capacity for dealing with anticipated project events.
• Reviewed survey programmes, analysed resource requirements and produced spreadsheet for determining staffing levels and schedules for Sussex ETE project. Analysis showed that a fulltime surveyor was required and allowed project to be completed to high quality, within time and budget and contributed 55% of turnover and profits for 2016/17.
• Created two Microsoft Excel templates for tendering and variation/change event process and instituted guidelines for their implementation across projects, which resulted in coordinated and streamlined management of project costs from tendering through project implementation and to closure. Costs were therefore easily monitored and costs for assessing period commercial performance forecast with more certainty.
• Provided support to young graduate engineers as a Delegated Engineer under the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) training scheme to mentor and encourage their progress and allow quicker review of periodic reports and evaluating evidences for development objectives. Examples of Projects Completed:
• London City Airport Interim Forecourt Utilities Diversion Project – Scope included provision of alternative drop-off and pick up facilities, car hire demolition, services / utilities diversion, and removal of existing street furniture to the forecourt and short stay car park area.
• Sussex Route CP5 Traction Power Supply Enhancement – Involved replacement of hook switches with track disconnectors (track isolation switches, TIS or controlled track switches, CTS) in order to achieve compliance with health and safety regulation by providing a suitable means for cutting off the supply of electrical energy and guaranteeing a secure isolation.
• CP5 Framework Contract for HV feeders and other Electrical Works with Network Rail - Included various works such as feeder routes in Wessex and Sussex regions of the UK. Works comprised HV cable and feeder route renewals together with telecoms (as required) and associated civils works such as under track and under road crossings, platform ducts and other buried cable routes with cable tension pulling calculations, cable ladders, steel ramps, GRP on post routes and bases, ballast board retention, design for renewal of DNOs, REBs, LOCs, transformers, and other track control cabinets bases and their associated cable trough routes..
• UK Power Networks Alliance Framework Project - Delivery of modifications of the existing HV power lines from overhead cable lines on pylons to more sustainable undergrounding of cables in the network, and new supplies to requirements of third party clients and to meet growth plans. Works comprised route design, cable pulling calculations, temporary works design for excavation of bases and joint bays, settlement calculations and checks. Notable projects included West Weybridge HDD works, Canterbury North & South substation works, Steyning to Worthing 132kV gas cable replacement, and Granta Park 11kV circuit.
