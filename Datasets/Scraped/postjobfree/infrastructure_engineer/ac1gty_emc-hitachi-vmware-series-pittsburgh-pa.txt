SUMMARY
Professional, U.S. Army Veteran, I have worked in the IT Industry for nearly two decades. Over those years, I have built on what was instilled into me during my first days in the Military, “Lead, Follow or Get Out of the Way”. I have found over the years that I have applied that mentality in many different and dynamically diverse organizations to overcome some of the most challenging and complicated solutions. I can work independently or teach others, I can learn if I do not know, and I can always function as a team member to contribute whatever and whenever possible, while others take the lead. Ultimately, I am looking for that next great challenge to take an organization to the extreme and cutting edge of technology, thank you for taking the time to read this brief summary.
