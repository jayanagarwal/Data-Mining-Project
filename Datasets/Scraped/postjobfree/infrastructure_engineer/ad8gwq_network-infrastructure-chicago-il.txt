PROJECTS
Intrusion Detection Using Honey Pots, Capstone, DePaul University Feb. 2024 - Mar. 2024
Implemented a honeypot-based intrusion detection system on the Kali Linux platform to simulate vulnerable systems and attract potential attackers monitoring honeypot traffic and analyzed logs to detect intrusion attempts, developing response strategies for threat mitigation
Engineered automated alerting systems to detect and report suspicious activities, resulting in a 40% decrease in response time and a 25% increase in threat identification accuracy, fortifying the organization's security posture
Achieved a 100% accuracy rate in detecting intrusion attempts: Auto-configuration triggered precise intrusion alerts on the Kali Linux VM, and Manual configuration targeted specific SSH ports (such as port 22 and 83), resulting in accurate intrusion attempt alerts

Network Security Project 2: Snort Alert Analysis with Splunk SIEM, DePaul University Nov. 2023 - Dec. 2023
Architected Splunk dashboards to analyze and visualize Snort-generated security events in real-time, facilitating proactive monitoring, achieved a 40% faster incident response time and reduced security breaches by 25%
Engineered customized Splunk dashboards to deliver real-time insights into Snort-generated security events, enabling proactive monitoring, resulting in a 40% faster incident response time and a 25% reduction in security breaches

Network Security Project 1: Traffic Redirection using Policy-based Routing Apr. 2023 – May 2023
The simulation comprises a scenario where a business network's HTTP server is simulated by a router accepting requests from an attacker simulated by a Linux host machine in a CML environment on port 22 (SSH) and port 20,21 (FTP)
Access control lists are used to define the traffic from the host IP to the destination at ports 20, 21, and 22
After using route - maps to match this traffic, the honeypot router's loopback interface is assigned as the next hop for the chosen traffic

Desktop Voice Assistance, SVPCET, Nagpur, India Sept. 2019 - Nov. 2020
Engineered voice-controlled software in Python/Django, enabling diverse tasks and home device control via verbal commands Developed intuitive voice-activated assistants for streamlined task management and media playback
Simplified user interaction with software, facilitating email management and application control through verbal commands Successfully executed the voice commands with an efficiency rate of 90%

VOLUNTEERING
NET 413 - INTRODUCTION TO LAN TECHNOLOGIES, Mentor, DePaul University Sept. 2022 - Nov. 2022
