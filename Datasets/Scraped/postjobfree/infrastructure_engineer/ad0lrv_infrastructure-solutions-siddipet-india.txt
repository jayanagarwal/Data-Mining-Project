Educational qualifications:

Course work:
1.Structural analysis.
2.Design of reinforced concrete structures.

4.Surveying.

Industry Oriented Skills:
i. Minor Project
Title: Fibre reinforced concrete
Description: This type of concrete has been more popular in recent years. In this type of concrete we used sheep wool as a fibre.We collected sheep wool from ambaripet location, after that we washed wool with water in order to remove particles like dust, blood etc. After washing the wool is dried, then we used to take off wool from the skin and we mixed that wool in concrete, concrete blocks are prepared and the blocks are sent to find the compressive strength.
ii. Major project
Tittle: Design and modelling of G+2 building, estimation and costing of building
Description: In this project we used AutoCAD software to draw a plan, after planning we used to install different components such as doors, windows, ventilators etc. We had taken a building as a reference and we compared the cost of building to the reference building. We got 2lakhs difference in cost when compared with the reference building.We used excel sheet to estimate total cost of building and finally we got 42,00,000rs for g+2building which we planned and designed.
