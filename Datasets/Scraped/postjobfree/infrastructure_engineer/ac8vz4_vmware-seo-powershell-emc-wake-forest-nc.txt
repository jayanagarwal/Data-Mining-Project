IT professional since **** with the majority of time spent working as a Systems Administrator of Windows based systems, mostly as a generalist and adapting to whatever needed to be done, such as: project manager of many small and medium projects, Team Lead of small teams of engineers, technology therapist, and many other hats. Over the last years the focus has started to be more emphasized and enthusiastic toward VMware, virtualization, and lately special attention toward automation of processes (PowerShell, SCORCH, etc). The next step is to take the experience and recent interests in the direction of DevOps, where computer language and infrastructure collide!
