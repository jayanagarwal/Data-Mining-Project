Random, knowledge and principals I have experience with and understand.

Server Patching - Doing Microsoft updates – best practice 1 month after the release of the patch so that any bad patches can be vetted out before they are updated on the live production servers.

Server Administration - I have seen during my experience one of the highest security risks ends up being password policy requirements. The best practice has been 16 Characters with all parameters required, It should contain upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters to be updated every 90days.

VMWare - I personally have 3 hosts running 2 different versions of VMware. one at 6.0 and 2 at 6.5, both hosting Microsoft server 2008, 2012, and 2016 at a 2012 functionality level. 2 redundant domain controllers on 2016.

Azure, this is a syncing tool to connect O365 and local DC's to a domain hosted externally off premise in most cases.

MDM - Mobile device management, The best way I have seen this done is to secure Wifi devices with mac address filtering to allow and deny device connectivity

MFA - Multi Factor Authentication. This can be done using a Microsoft or Google authentication app installed on a second device e.g. phone, The phone app provides the secure code every 30 seconds when attempting to log in to a workstation or laptop.

O365 - Office 365 Microsoft will provide an O365 portal to manage an organization's office software deployments in one location to log usage and accounts to the users and or machines
