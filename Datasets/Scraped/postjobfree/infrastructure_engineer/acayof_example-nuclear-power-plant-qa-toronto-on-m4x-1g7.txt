"Mazen was a Senior Project Manager for the Bruce Power PMO where he led all aspects of the 2 most complicated IT/Construction projects. Both projects where in-flight and experiencing significant challenges at the time he joined the PMO team. Mazen did an excellent job immersing himself in the projects, taking ownership and successfully prioritizing and managing all issues and risks. I could trust him to escalate appropriately and I can’t emphasize enough how often this was required. Despite the challenges, Mazen was always diplomatic and professional working well with all stakeholders in this matrix organization. Through his efforts, Mazen was successful in getting the project back “on track”. I would hire Mazen again, and have no reservation recommending Mazen on similar assignments.", BP IT PMO Manager (posted in Linkedin).
