Actively participated in a mobile workshop.
Many colleges participated in paper presentations. Humanoid Robot using Robotic arm
The robot is useful in places where humans nd it di cult to reach but human voice reaches or remote controller.
It is one of the important stages of humanoid robots. It can easily recognize the voice commands and runs smoothly. Further enhancement in the project can be used for Home security and military purposes where the commands can be given to robots without risk by increasing the range and by installing Night vision cameras.
