PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
The miSHARP application is developed for use on handheld devices and it allows CS operators (drivers) to perform reporting activities related to their trips accurately and quickly. The handheld application also allows CS to track the progress of their operators on a real-time basis. The miSHARP application receives and sends messages to the SHARP Transport Management System via gateway over GPRS network. The gateway server application written in ASP.NET is used for tracking the messages and for application maintenance. The gateway is used for user authentication, storing and forwarding messages, synchronizing date time, error reporting and logging. miSHARP application is built with a set of considerations to ensure it meets the requirements as defined by Christian Salvesen. These considerations as follows:
 Sufficient flexibility is built into the system to allow for future business growth. 
 miSHARP system would incorporate a robust, resilient messaging architecture to ensure guaranteed delivery of messages sent to and received from SHARP
 sending client signature to SHARP in digital format
 The application design would ensure that the application is robust and scales up to handle the increased user volume without compromising the performance expectations
 The application would utilize an extensible and layered architecture in order to support multi-lingual and region specific business rules / functions
 The application would be designed to run on Windows Mobile 5 devices, and ensure it works across all devices which would run Windows Mobile 5
 miSHARP would interface with external applications like TomTom GPS Navigator and the CID for telemetry information sending and receiving. In regions where the CID device is not present, miSHARP would capture GPS information from a GPS device.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The DCS (Data Capturing System) application is used at different WWL terminals (Ports) for basic terminal operations like bar code printing, scanning and capturing locations information. The Scanner Application is an Application build for the LXE MX5 Scanner handled device in this project to enhance the performance and make the Process more user friendly. The User downloads the XML file with the details of the Cargos. When he scans the cargo items the Application validates the Cargo against the input XML file that the user downloaded and stores the details of each Cargo line item in the Pocket PC in a local XML file. At the end of any logical activity, the user comes to the back office, connects the Pocket PC to the local PC which is connected to the network and transfers the XML File to a centralized system, where the data in Merged with the Centralized Data Base for Universal access.
