Good Morning,

My name is Matthew Dutton and I am contacting you this afternoon to submit my
resume for the iOS engineer position you currently have listed on your website. I
wanted to forward my resume to your office in hopes of possibly starting a
mutually beneficial relationship. I am currently a student at Full Sail University in
Winter Park, FL pursuing my Bachelors Degree in Mobile Development. I am
expected to graduate the first week of April and would love the opportunity to
begin my career with a company like yours.

The mobile development degree specializes in teaching both iOS and Android
development. As such I have learned the iOS SDK, X-Code, Objective-C and
have also a basic understanding of Apple’s new Swift language. I have also
learned the Android SDK, Android Studio, Eclipse, and the Java language.
I realize that I am still a student but I feel that we could be beneficial to each
other. I would begin my career with an intriguing company that has a great sense
of style and obviously cares about their end product. You would gain a budding,
intelligent, young developer that would be willing to grow and flourish with the
company.

A copy of my resume can be downloaded from my personal Dropbox at:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48458912/M_Dutton_Resume.pdf

Also a sample of the source code for some of the school projects I have done
and the apps that I have placed into the iOS store. Also included are a number of
the Android projects that I have worked on for school. These can be found in my
Github at the following address:

I hope that my experience, while admittedly limited, shows the potential that your
Company is looking for. I would love the opportunity to work with you, both before
I graduate as well as after.

To
Whom
It
May
Concern:

My
name
is
Michael
Celey
and
I
am
writing
this
letter
in
recommendation
of
Matthew

Dutton.

I
am
a
professor
at
Full
Sail
University
and
I
have
known
Matt
since
he
entered
his

first
mobile
development
class
in
September
of
2013.

In
the
time
since
first
meeting
Matt,
I

have
come
to
know
him
as
a
very
adaptable,
resilient,
and
hard-

working
individual.

Full
Sail
moves
at
a
very
fast
pace
and,
though
many
may
try,
not
all
students
can
keep
up

with
the
accelerated
courses
and
not
stumble,
however,
Matt
has
done
just
that.

Matt
is
the

last
remaining
student
in
our
vanguard
class
and
he
has
handled
the
challenges
and

setbacks
that
go
with
being
a
vanguard
student
with
ease.

Whenever
we
needed
to
change

his
schedule
to
accommodate
our
class
launches,
he
communicated
professionally
and
made

sure
to
be
where
we
needed
him.

Whenever
we
launched
a
new
assignment
that
might

have
been
too
hard
for
most
students,
Matt
saw
it
as
a
challenge
and
rose
to
the
occasion.

I
personally
had
Matt
as
a
student
in
two
Android
programming
classes
this
year.

Not
only

did
Matt
finish
his
work
earlier
than
any
other
student,
but
he
also
went
above
and
beyond

on
every
assignment,
adding
in
functionality
and
polish
that
wasn’t
required
by
any
rubric.

During
lab
hours
and
group
projects,
Matt
was
a
leader
in
the
classroom
and
helped
other

students
whenever
the
assignment
allowed
it.

Matt
is
one
of
the
hardest
working
students
I
have
ever
had
and
I
would
happily

recommend
him
for
a
position
in
any
organization.

If
you
would
like
to
speak
to
me
about

Matt,
please
feel
free
to
contact
me
at
the
phone
number
or
email
below.

Cheers,

Michael
Celey
