•Used WebRTC to establish a secure connection to a policy server which is used to regulate the Trustica app to adhere to web policies for messages stored, size of attachments, etc.
•Conformed the file and folders to be stored locally as Realm Objects
•The UI for this container was made more dynamic by giving it other features like Add or Delete by swiping left on the particular cell
•Used GraphQL, to model requests to fetch our users' information. This was universally used throughout our application and enabled us to simply any requests for a user and his or her information.
•One such use was for managing the various user records and accessing them in a much more efficient manner as the object would have to be retrieved once (in the present scenario) and its properties would be easily accessible on the client side, reducing the need for making unnecessary network calls for property access.
•Image and Document Pickers were implemented to import files or images that are locally stored on the device.
•Developed an attestation library source code in Obj-C which was used as a standalone product and as a component in the main application TRUSTICA

•Extensively tested the attestation library in regular and compromised devices to demonstrate its effectiveness.
•Extensively documented and recorded the test cases for the attestation library in Confluence
•Involved in the functional automated testing of the attestation library with the help of Bazel.
•Developed and finished incomplete VoIP prototypes demonstrating the viability of PJSIP libraries.
•VoIP capabilities were added to the application by developing according to the prototypes built earlier.
•Tested numerous iterations of PJSIP libraries for compatibility with TRUSTICA.
•Modified the script generating the library to include the current version of OpenSSL.
•Used Bazel to test out the capabilities and potency of the Firebase real-time database and the token messaging for the FCM - Firebase cloud messaging.
•Conducted sessions with Web Developers to discuss implementing Firebase Functions for VoIP and Push Notifications and their utility in the application.
•Tested the SIP server, application, and their relationship for critical situations like a hack or maintenance shutdown.
•Removed the VoIP capabilities to generate a releasable build for TRUSTICA.
•Implemented PushKit on the client side in conformance with the new rules set by Apple concerning VoIP.
•Implemented CallKit for the app to use the device's call capabilities
•Dev tested the release build extensively for any vulnerabilities
•Created a new version of the attestation library in Obj-C which is solely to be used as a standalone product where other clients can use the custom object generated to produce the results they desire.
•Used rake commands for unit tests for application building locally.
•Implemented the feature to call using the recent call History stored on the device.
•Mapped out device tokens onto Firebase Realtime Database for PushKit reference.
•Used Bazel to create the attestation library to dynamically link to the main enterprise app.
