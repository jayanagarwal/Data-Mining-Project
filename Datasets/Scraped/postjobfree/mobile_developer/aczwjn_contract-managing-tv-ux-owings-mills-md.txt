Objective
I am actively searching for employment in the Austin area. I'm in the process of moving to Austin this month and I will be paying for my own relocation. But if an opportunity comes up before then, I would be happy to come to Austin earlier for interviews or a start date. I have skills acquired through work experience and education that will aid in my success in the workplace. I am a team player and a willing learner. I am just looking for an opportunity to grow within a company and to continue developing my skills. Education
