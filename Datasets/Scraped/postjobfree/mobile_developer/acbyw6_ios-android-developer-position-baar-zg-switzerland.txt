Computer engineer with a business orientation. I am specializing in mobile application
development, especially in iOS (but Android is also very familiar to me). I am an entrepreneur
and I got acquired knowledge of business participation in multiple events and courses. I
worked in several startups and know how they act from the seed stage of their foundation to
the product release.
I am looking for a job in Switzerland where I will bring all my experience and enthusiasm. I
have a B-stay permit which lets me work in Switzerland.
