PROJECTS
ECO-FRIENDLY REFRIGERANT FOR AUTOMOBILE AIR CONDITION 12/17 - 07/18
• An eco-friendly refrigerant for automobile air conditioning is designed to reduce environmental impact while maintaining cooling efficiency. Traditional refrigerants like R-134a have high global warming potential (GWP), contributing to climate change. Newer alternatives, such as R-1234yf and CO2 (R-744), have much lower GWP, making them more environmentally friendly. R-1234yf is compatible with existing systems and has a GWP of just 4, compared to R-134a's 1,430. CO2, a natural refrigerant, has a GWP of 1 and is non-toxic, but requires higher operating pressures. These eco-friendly refrigerants help automakers meet global regulations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They also offer the potential for improved energy efficiency in vehicle air conditioning systems.
ELECTRIC CAR 10/18 - 05/19
• An electric car (E-car) is a vehicle powered by an electric motor instead of a traditional internal combustion engine. It uses electricity stored in batteries, which are charged by plugging into an electrical outlet or charging station. Electric cars produce zero emissions at the tailpipe, making them environmentally friendly compared to gasoline-powered cars. They are typically quieter and require less maintenance since they have fewer moving parts. E-cars can accelerate quickly due to the instant torque provided by electric motors. EPOXY, SISAL FIBER,PVC FOAM AND CUTTLEBONE POWDER BASED SANDWICH 04/23 - 06/24
• A sandwich composite structure made of epoxy, PVC foam, sisal fiber, and cuttlebone powder is designed for lightweight and high-strength applications. The epoxy resin acts as the primary binding agent, providing rigidity and durability to the composite. PVC foam serves as the core material, offering low density and excellent insulation properties while reducing the overall weight of the structure. Sisal fiber, a natural and renewable material, is used as reinforcement, enhancing the tensile strength and impact resistance of the composite. The addition of cuttlebone powder, a natural calcium carbonate source, improves the composite's stiffness and resistance to compression.
