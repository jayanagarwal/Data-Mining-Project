Believe that practice leadership as the current buzzword in the project industry, and with good reason: can lead, can deliver with all the time feeling need to improve myself as a leader at some points

3.Team management

4.Negotiation

Going back to the communication skill—a lot of this communication has to do with negotiating the use of resources, budgets, schedules, scope creep, and a variety of other compromises that are unavoidable. Knowing how to negotiate well so that all parties are satisfied is a key skill for the successful project manager.

5.Personal organization

I say, I cannot give what you do not have? How can I get things done and organize work for other people if my own personal life and projects are disorganized and going nowhere? I get organized personally, and will immediately improve other skills.
