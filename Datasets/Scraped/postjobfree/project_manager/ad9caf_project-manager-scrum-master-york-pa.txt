Senior Project Manger / Scrum Master
Results-driven Project Manager with 15+ years of experience driving impactful software development, systems integration, infrastructure, and business process projects (small to very large) across diverse industries (Private and public sector) and methodologies. I have led cross-functional teams (5 to 25 members) working in close cooperation with colleagues through all phases of the project life cycle to modernize business systems, achieve excellence, optimize processes, translate requirements into actionable solutions, and simplify the path from business needs to technical implementation using PMBOK and Agile methodologies for organizational change management. Evaluates solutions, assesses risks, anticipates bottlenecks, provides escalation management, makes tradeoffs, and helps balance the business needs versus technical constraints. Translates data into meaningful decisions, optimizes processes, and delivers value in the customers’ program and product space. Manages project resources, personnel, equipment, materials, and priorities to optimize scope, schedule, and cost ($50,000 to multi-million dollars) across multiple projects simultaneously. Occasionally turned around troubled projects from red to green as well as trained and mentored other less-experienced Project Managers.
