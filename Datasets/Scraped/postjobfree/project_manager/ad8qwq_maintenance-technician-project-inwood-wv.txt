Love these people are like my second family. Worked full time for about 5 years and part time once I went back to the irs. Was having a lot of health issues and the irs was an easier job to do and more forgiving as far as time off. So in Feb of 24 the business wasn't doing to good and I decided to get my tools and focus on one job. Tire tech

Changed tires oil changes brakes. Before I left I was on service calls going to farms and fixing tractor tires for farms. I liked the job just didn't pay enough. The wear and tear on my body plus the drive was decent. Janitor
