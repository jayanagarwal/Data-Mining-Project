Accomplished Project Manager focused on ensuring that projects are planned, coordinated, and completed in a timely, efficient, effective, and profitable manner.

Exceptionally experienced in creating and maintaining project schedules, client site meetings, change order creation and management, and project closeouts. I am very comfortable organizing cross-functional activities for the completion of projects, and have built and maintained strong client relationships.
