QUALIFICATIONS
Completing the lion’s share of total projects, I have often been considered the “workhorse” of the Development Department. The heavier the workload, the more efficient my performance becomes, and I continuously outperform fellow associates. With extensive, all inclusive experience in planning and construction project management, first hand knowledge to design and construct a space within budget to meet the needs of the occupant, combined with my organizational and communication skills, self motivation to manage multiple regional projects from my home office, and my work ethic as a military veteran in the Army Corps of Engineers, I am an asset in any branch of the development field. I am proficient in Outlook, Microsoft Project, Acruent RESource, basic word and spreadsheet software applications and minimal AutoCAD.
