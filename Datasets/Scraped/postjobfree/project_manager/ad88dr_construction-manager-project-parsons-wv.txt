To Whom It May Concern,
Please consider this letter to be my strong recommendation for Mr. Charles Wamsley as a Construction Project Manager.
Omni has had the opportunity to work closely and collaborate with Charlie on several projects over the past years when he was a Senior Project Manager with Accelerated Construction Services. These projects include multiple building types from small tenant fit-outs to multi-million dollar ground up construction. These projects also range from bid projects to design/build delivery. Charles was intimately involved in the planning and construction of these facilities. The on-site and in office project management provided by Mr. Wamsley is very valuable to a successful project. He has worked very professionally and collaboratively to ensure the building is delivered on time and within budget. A safe, secure and well maintained construction site has been provided that makes observation and inspection visits simple and focused. Attention to detail and craftsmanship is evident throughout Charlie’s projects. I am glad to have worked with him as he is a talented and hardworking individual. Omni Associates Architects is pleased to highly recommend Mr. Charles Wamsley for your projects. Sincerely,
Adam Rohaly AIA, NCARB, LEED AP
