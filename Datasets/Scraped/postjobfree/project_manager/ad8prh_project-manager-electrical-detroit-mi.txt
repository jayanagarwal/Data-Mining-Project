Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE)
Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, MI

Professional Experience:

Senior Electrical Engineer/Project Manager (6/21 to7/22)
Roush Industries/Performance Driven Workplace, Livonia, MI
Made quality decisions (accepted or rejected) based on provided quantitative outlines, performed routine quality inspections on industrial and commercial items while implementing 5S protocol, monitored operation’s output and associated production standards, maintained and organized all records, documentation and other files associated with quality engineering and inspection tasks, removed and documented all rejected product samples in the appropriate log books.
Distribution Project Manager (8/00 to 12/2020)
Detroit Media Partnership (Detroit Free Press and Detroit News), Detroit, MI
Managed a regional-wide sales force in metro-Detroit, where I was responsible for hiring, training and placing employees at locations to yield the highest sells.
Electrical Design Release Engineer (7/01 to 4/03)
Exemplar Manufacturing Company/Aerotek Livonia, MI
Based on the company’s Product Directional Letter (PDL) that outlines future vehicle changes, responsibilities entailed the design of the vehicle’s electrical wire harnesses, power distribution and electrical components along with supplier integration of automotive parts and schematic revisions. I released parts and services into Ford’s WERS software system thus denoting cost and timing for company approval. Supported Exemplar wiring launches in Mexico that involved demonstrating to line workers the correct routing of various harnesses. Conducted end-of-line testing and diagnostics to determine and resolve any wiring issues. Supported all prototype build events to ascertain & correct any problems that may impede assembly in the final stages of production launch.
Lead Engineer-Material Cost Reduction (MCR) (9/98 to 8/00)
Ford Motor Company/Aerotek, Dearborn, MI
Managed the electrical team that consisted of Core Engineering, Wixom Assembly Plant-PVT & Vehicle Operations (VO), suppliers, buyers and cost estimators to generate cost saving opportunities for items such as wiring, body modules, batteries, connectors, alternators, etc. The savings were generated via Total Cost Management methods, Value Analysis (VA/VE) and brainstorming workshops. Responsibility, also, entailed: tracking average cost vs. target, performing prototype investigation through plant trials, design validation and durability test to confirm cost reductions saved money without degradation of component or vehicle quality, document engineering changes, release parts into WERS and ensure assembly plant implementation timing.
