Over my 35 years experience in Construction. I have gained the skills and qualities necessary to perform at a very high standard in my role as superintendent. I have a passion for this work and a lifelong dedication to learning and improving myself. My desire to support my coworkers in collaboration and team effort let me fit into any team seamlessly. I am conscientious in taking good care of your customers and owners so that they become long term advocates and friends in your company. My experience has given me the knowledge to problem solve and take ownership of difficult problems when they occur and usually have viable solutions to remedy any problems. Finally perhaps my greatest strength is my loyalty and trustworthiness. You can rely on me to always be a positive role model for your company.
