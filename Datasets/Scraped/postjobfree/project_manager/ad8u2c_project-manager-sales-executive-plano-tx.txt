Sales/ Project Manager

Results-driven and motivated with client expectations at the forefront. Ethical professional skilled in creative problem solving, developing relationship with new client as well as maintaining client base, and promoting company loyalty. Detail-oriented with exceptional interpersonal skills for meeting high expectations and delivering quality product.

While working at Federal Heath I also did project management. One of the most important tasks that a project manager has is commutation with the sales person and the customer. I feel that a sales person needs a whole team from beginning of the project to the end.
