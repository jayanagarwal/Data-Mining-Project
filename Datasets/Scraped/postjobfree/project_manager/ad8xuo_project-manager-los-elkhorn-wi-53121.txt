Summary of Experiences:
With over three decades of experience in the construction industry, I have demonstrated expertise as a skilled framer, supervisor, and general contractor. My career began in 1984 as a freelance framer, contributing to projects across Los Angeles County and Reno, NV. Over the years, I progressed to supervisory roles, overseeing framing teams on custom home projects and large multi-family buildings. I have specialized in finish carpentry, including custom built-ins, mouldings, and exterior finishing, with a focus on high-end homes in prestigious locations such as Beverly Hills and Malibu. Throughout my career, I have managed subcontractors, ensured adherence to project timelines and quality standards, and maintained a reputation for delivering exceptional craftsmanship.
