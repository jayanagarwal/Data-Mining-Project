The requirement of this project was to create 3 different customer sites that should be able to communicate with each other by implementing MPLS TE.
Configure MPLS in the core of the network.
Configure BGP to communicate with PE routers and OSPF among themselves, also used RIPv2 for routing exchange with PE routers.
TE tunnels were setup with bandwidth constraint.

• IP Routing Lab:
The purpose of this lab was to became familiar with routers and their configuration parameters.
Make physical connectivity between Cisco routers and check IP route table. Configure RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP among routers.
Redistribution by configure one of the IP routing protocols as IGP, and then configure BGP and advertising local routes to neighbors. Inform the IGP neighbors about the routes that you received via eBGP.
