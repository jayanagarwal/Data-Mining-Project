§ Highly knowledgeable, experienced, passionate, and result oriented API and UI Automation Engineer/Architect and Site Reliability Engineer SRE with wide experience in managing and improving the automation, scalability, and performance of complex systems. Expertise in SQA with Automation tools (expert/architect level) designing and building up test automation systems. Highly collaborative identifying and resolving issues in agile scrum environments. Proven track record implementing innovative solutions resulting in improved system reliability, cost savings, and increased customer satisfaction. WHAT DO I BRING TO THE TABLE?
§ Started Career as Python, Java Developer: Happen to be Python developer and then after backend web application developer when started career back in year 2005. Strong analytical and handling multiple concurrent priorities skills. Highly adaptable and able to thrive in a fast-paced and client-facing role. Employee recognition award from Hewlett-Packard. Designed, developed high-volume, low-latency applications
§ Ability to build Automation from scratch: Designed and built a process, from scratch, whereby, an Automation framework receives notice of a completed nightly build through CI/CD tool, re-images the hard drive of a lab test-machines. It then downloads and installs the nightly build on the Webserver. It then launches a build- verification test. Runs regression test on schedule, then emails the results to a list of designated recipients and simultaneously posts the results on confluence page. Presented framework that assured complete script portability, across machines and sites, enabling automation scripts to run anywhere, on any supported platform, with zero modification. This process was so well received, everyone currently championing it. Designed and built interface and web-services test automation frameworks in support of continuous integration in a test-driven development (TDD) and behavior driven development (BDD) environments.
