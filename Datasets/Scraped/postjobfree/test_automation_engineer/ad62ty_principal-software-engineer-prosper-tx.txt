Description: The Omni-channel consumer wants to use all channels simultaneously, and retailers using an Omni-channel approach will track customers across all channels, not just one or two. Using Omni-channel retailing while working with the "Connected Consumer”, all shopping channels work from the same database of products, prices, promotions, etc. Instead of perceiving a variety of touch-points as part of the same brand, Omni-channel retailers let consumers experience the brand, not a channel within a brand. Merchandise and promotions are not channel specific, but rather consistent across all retail channels. The bricks-and-mortar stores become an extension of the supply chain in which purchases may be made in the store, but are researched through other "channels" of communication. With Omni-channel retailing, marketing is made more efficient with offers that are relative to a specific consumer determined by purchase patterns, social network affinities, website visits, loyalty programs, and other data mining techniques.
Macys.com is the on-line brand extension of Macy's, an e-commerce application. Fusing advanced systems with merchandising and marketing acumen, Macys.com is one of the fastest-growing segments of Macy's business. One of the key business parts of macys.com is online shopping
