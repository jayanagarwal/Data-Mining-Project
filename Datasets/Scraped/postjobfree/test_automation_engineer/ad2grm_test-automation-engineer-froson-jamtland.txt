I have * years of experience as a test automation engineer specialising in tools like Selenium, Tosca, UFT, SoapUI, Appium,… and I’ve worked on many projects in both Belgium and Switzerland. In May 2022 I moved to Sweden permanently to start a new life. I've been volunteering at a campsite and renovating my own house since then.
