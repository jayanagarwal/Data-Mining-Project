Distributed Learning Management System: Spring 2017
• Designed a web application in UNIX, used for online interaction between students and professors using BSD sockets.
• Developed front-end using HTML, back-end database using MySQL and developed c code for multi-threaded server and client. Threat alert System using IoT: Fall 2016
• Designed a threat alert system using Raspberry Pi (Debian OS) in which images are captured by Camera, given as an input to IBM Bluemix Watson’s platform for visual recognition, which extract text from an image and send the text using MQTT server. 64-bit signed Multiplier and Divider: Fall 2017
• Designed and verified synthesizable, sequential multiplier and divider RTL design having ALU, programmed on Synopsys VCS in Linux platform and performed static timing analysis by varying delay to find out suitable clock for the circuit. Simulation of MPLS using GNS3 with Cisco IOS: Spring 2017
• Responsible for understanding of Cisco IOS using CLI, developed a network simulation using GNS3 and implemented the topology for understanding how MPLS protocol works. Configured routers for this implementation & analyzed packet flow using Wireshark. NS3/NS2 Simulation over Wireless Network: Spring 2017
• Simulated wireless network using NS3, analyzed the traffic flow using Wireshark and developed C++ code for throughput calculation, enabling RTS/CTS, adding node into the network, changing distance between nodes.
• Developed python code for comparison of Routing Algorithm (DSDV, DSR, AODV) using NS3 simulation.
