EXPERIENCE PORTFOLIO

03/13 –07/18, Applications Engineer
Sumitomo Drive Technologies, Verona, VA

Provided subject matter expertise (SME) as a mechanical engineer with 17 years of experience in speed reducer design and applications for industrial as well as precision gear reducers and gear motors
Developed quotes for mining conveyor, wastewater treatment, and USACE dam gate rehabilitation projects, varying by speed reducer size, quantity, and features ranging between $2K and $4.2M, for projects valued at an average of ~$65M annually
Configured speed reducer packages to meet project requirements, performed initial speed reducer selections based on basic reducer ratings - mechanical and thermal, evaluated the next smaller size, with addition cooling features, to test requirements at lower production prices for buyer (client),
Quality assured / verified engineers’ project proposals, including project specifications and drawings from US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), trained new employee engineers on job tasks and responsibilities, verified power transmission shafts manufactured from AISI 4140 steel and AGMA standards applied during manufacturing and assembly
Performed SME engineering, quality assurance, and verification on: ball bearing, cylindrical roller bearing, spherical roller bearing, and thrust bearing arrangements for power transmission shafts, shaft seals types / materials (e.g., standard double-lip nitrile, Viton (fluorine), and polyacrylate seals, grease-purged taconite seals, grease-purged labyrinth seals, cassette seals, braided-packing seals, waste-packing seals), axial- and radial-cooling fans, air-to-oil and water-to-oil heat exchangers, plate-heat exchangers, plus shell and tube heat exchangers, oil immersion heaters, oil splash, oil bath, shaft-driven pump, and motor-driven pump-oil lubrication systems, curved-jaw, flexible grid, flexible-gear, and fluid couplings for high-speed shafts, flexible-gear and rigid moment couplings for low speed shafts, and gear ratios of helical gear pairs and bevel gear pairs

06/07 – 03/13, Product Engineer
Sumitomo Drive Technologies, Verona, VA

Contributed to in-house, proprietary engineering training knowledge database, prepared engineering test procedures and instructions, performed failure analysis evaluations created test reports, resulting in completed failure analysis reports
Provided SME engineering advice to sales, customer service, marketing, and catalog updates, performed quality control (quality assurance) and repair to warranty evaluations
Performed research and development (R&D), completed project identifying a vibration analysis method for pinpointing Cyclo defects, including site visits to resolve noise, vibration, and oil-leak seal problems
Performed quality assurance inspections on installation of reducers per leaking speed reducer seals at water treatment facilities, identified issues (shaft corrosion due to reducers’ environment causing premature oil seal wear) resulting in recommendation for new seal design
Recorded / analyzed temperature variations using temperature guns and thermal imaging cameras, as well as no-load and full-load vibration levels using a vibration analyzer

08/05 –05/07, Engineering Team Leader
Kongsberg Automotive (formerly Capro), Swainsboro, GA

Performed design reviews to evaluate, update, and track Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results, cable travel and load calculations, Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (DFMEA) / test plans or Design Verification Plan & Report (DVP&R) for cable projects valued at $5K to $50K as engineering SME
Managed 2-3 facility project engineers for projects, supervised two engineers, researched, analyzed, and resolved problem including schedule delays / conflicts, resource shortages, quality problems, updated project time lines for project scheduling, introduced GANTT charts for production management, resulting in elimination of errors and omissions with 5% improvement for productivity within first month
Conducted weekly project meetings between engineering and sales and engineering managers to discuss work load, demands for mechanical control cables (seasonal), manufacturing schedules for lawn mowers, lawn tractors, lawn trimmers, and golf carts, cables for snow-removal machines, completing an average of 15 cable projects per week, participated in division’s 2007 Engineering Strategy meeting resulting in analysis of existing processes, improvements, and future goals set for performance standards
Served as factory’s engineering SME representative during sales presentations, served as SME advisor during company-wide engineering meetings for three factories, liaised with GA, TN, LA, and TX sites to improve consumer’s outdoor power tools for Husqvarna, Craftsman, McCulloch, Poulan, Weed Eater with modifications, resulting in reduced costs and manpower
Re-established Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP) Georgia facilities manufacturing processes (after attrition), resulting in improved production and productivities for manufacturing brake cables and throttle mechanisms sold to golf cart manufacturers Club Car and E-Z-Go
Improved GA’s non-conformance management process resulting in improved ability to identify problems and faster resolutions, resulting in fewer defective products

01/03 – 08/05, Product Engineer
Sumitomo Drive Technologies, Chesapeake, VA

Researched, analyzed, identified, and resolved vibrational issues for reducer housing for client, resulting in retaining client with engineered solutions, visited speed reducer installation sites to resolve noise problems, performed failure analysis evaluations and completed failure analysis test reports
Prepared engineering test procedures / instructions, recorded / analyzed temperature variations using temperature guns and thermal imaging cameras, as well as recorded / analyzed no-load and full-load vibration levels using a vibration analyzer, automated engineering calculations via Excel spreadsheets
Performed orientation to new engineer hires on products, processes, and procedures (2-3 times annually)
