Diagnosed and resolved field operation issues, prevented equipment failures, mitigated safety hazards, and minimized operational downtime by utilizing specialized skills in vibration, acoustics, and system dynamics, conducting over 10 complex vibration studies and assessments. Optimized reliability and efficiency of compressor systems by mastering proprietary Reciprocating Compressor Analysis (RCA) software to conduct advanced studies on 5+ compressor systems (Ariel, Dresser- Rand, Siemens Energy, Neuman & Esser), simulating compressor performance behaviors'. Executed enhanced Pre-Study Damper Analyses (Design Approach 1) and Acoustical & Pulsation Simulation
(Design Approach 2) employing API 618 Reciprocating Compressor Guideline on 10+ projects to generate pulsation control designs, limiting operational downtime and saving cost. Spearheaded the process of designing, modeling, and simulation of a baseline system performance model using proprietary Mapak Visual Editor (MVE) software to conduct rigorous analyses, optimizing compressor units, vessels, piping, and other components, preventing equipment collapse. Evaluated system performance model outcomes using DataMiner software and optimized current designs through iterative comparison of alternatives, targeted modifications, and re-modeling until optimal results were achieved which reduced downtime by 15% across all projects. Delivered innovative recommendations and designs to over 5 key clients (Rotating Offshore Singapore, Siemens Energy India, Shell Australia) in 4 major international projects, across Canada, the USA, and Singapore, positively impacting operational efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Mechanical engineer equipped with relevant experience in the Oil & Gas and Construction industry. Offers a solid background in consulting, design, and modeling to maximize quality and reliability. Adept in simulation and optimization, utilizing AutoCAD, Naviswork, and other softwares, for robust and cutting-edge design solutions. Focused on diligent work ethics, cross functional collaboration, and the ability to efficiently deliver engineering solutions that improve processes and products. Cheras, Kuala Lumpur
