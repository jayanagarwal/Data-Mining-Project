Research Scientist: 11/2014-7/2019. Washington University School of medicine, St. Louis MO.
Study of targeted TRAIL-based drugs as potent anti-ovary cancer protein drugs.
1. Successfully created a protein production system using stable transduced CHO cell lines trained from adhersive to suspension system. This CHO suspension FBS free system has produced thousands of milligrams of our two major anti-ovary cancer recombinant proteins. Protein quality and quantity was titrated by Western blot and ELISA. The sequences of these two proteins were confirmed by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. These proteins were successfully purified by FPLC using both His or flag tag affinity columns and size exclusion columns.
2. Maintained more than twenty cell lines of ovary and pancreatic cancers for in vitro anti-tumor drug killing screening assays, and in vivo tumor xenograft models. Ovary and pancreatic gene makers of MUC16 and mesothelin protein expression levels were panel detected by using two antibodies, Flow Cytometry and Western blotting.
3. Based on the ovary and pancreatic cancer gene maker expression levels, ten cell lines were selected, and the anti-tumor killing efficacy of six anti-ovary and pancreatic recombinant TRAIL and Sigma II ligand small molecule drugs were tested.
4. Successfully generated a difficult ovarian mouse xenograft tumor model by injecting fresh ovary cancer cells or implanting tumor chunks for the large number of experimental mice.

Research Scientist (contract): 10/2012-10/2014. Dept of protein expression and purification, Bayer Co./Monsanto Co.. Saint Louis, MO.
Insecticidal toxin proteins production and purification.
1. More than thirty different insecticidal toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis were cloned and subcloned. All interested proteins were expressed in E. Coli system in small scale. Insecticidal toxin proteins were purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Protein quantity and quality were tested in SDS-PAGE gels and sequence identified by HPLC-MS/MS. Protein produced in medium or large-scale proteins were further purified by Sciex HPLC and/or Akta FPLC.
2. Final insecticidal toxin proteins were quantively aliquoted, labelled, documented, and stored in -80C for the downstream protein crystallization and corn root worm killing efficacy teams.

Director of mass spectrometry core: 06/2006-09/2012. St. Louis University School of medicine, St. Louis, MO.
Run and maintained a mass spectrometry core facility
1. Mass spectrometry core facility were housed an Applied BioSystems QSTAR XL Hybrid HPLC/MS/MS Triple quadruple System, an Applied BioSystems MALDI-TOF/TOF Analyzer, a Dionex UltiMate by LC Packings Nano-HPLC system, an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech IPGphor protein first dimensional system, a BioRAD PROTEAN IEF Cell protein first dimensional system, a BioRAD Criterion protein secondary dimensional system, etc.
2. Maintenances of mass spectromerts: routely cleaned up, tuned up and calibration of all the mass spectrometers.
3. Sample preparations: Protein samples from mouse tissues, bacteria, fungi, and plant tissues were extracted, purified and separated by one-dimension and two dimension SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Enriched protin samples will be separated by C18 column or direct infusion using LC-MS/MS.
4 Method development and validation of protein identification, peptide sequencing. Data were analyzed using Analyst QS software V5.1 from Applied BioSystems. Data gating and stringency settings of Analyst QS were adjusted based on the individual data quality. Assay reports were generated and documented for the customers.
5. Training and help customers to use the Applied BioSystems MALDI-TOF/TOF Analyzer.

Postdoctoral Associate: 03/2003-05/2006. Danforth Science Center, St. Louis, MO.
Study of GGT I functions on Arabidopsis meristem development.
1. Several genes were cloned and expressed in E. coli or yeast systems for protein production. Expressed proteins were affinity purified using different columns depending on the tags. Protein identities were confirmed by Western blot and HPLC-MS/MS.
2. One of our key proteins, GST-GGT I and mutant proteins were prepared. These two total proteins were extracted and separated by ultracentrifuge into a membrane portion and a non-membrane portion. The different protein fractions were separated by 1D followed 2D SDS-PAGE. The interested 2D gel protein spots were identified by Applied BioSystems QSTAR XL Hybrid HPLC/MS/MS mass spectrometer.

Ph. D Graduate: 09/1998-01/2003. Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.
Manipulating antifungal diene lipid in avocado fruits by regulating its key biosynthesis steps.
1. An anti-fungal diene lipid was routinely prepared and extracted from different parts of avocado fruits, leaves, and different treated avocado fruits.
2. Quantitatively measured the anti-fungal diene lipid under different treatments by HPLC and GC-MS. Several Ethylene treated vs no treated subtractive cDNA libraries were prepared. Three of the most interesting genes were coloned from the subtractive cDNA libraries.
3. The multiple relationships among linoleic acid lipid, antifungal diene lipid levels, two fatty acid desaturases and one fatty acid elongase at transcript levels, and two fatty acid desaturases enzyme activities were studied by Northern blot, desaturase activity assays, HPLC and GC-MS.
4 The results demonstrate relationships among the transcripts from the fatty acid desaturase genes, the synthesis of the precursor of anti-fungal diene, the antifungal diene content and quiescence of C. gloeosporioides in unripe fruits and ripen avocado fruits.
