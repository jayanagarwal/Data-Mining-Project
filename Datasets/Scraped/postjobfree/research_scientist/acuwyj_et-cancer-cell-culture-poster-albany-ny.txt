Research Scientist, Nano-bio Constellation, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Albany, NY, 2015 – Present, Postdoctoral Fellow, Nano-bio Constellation, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Albany, NY, 2013- 2015
Signaling pathway studies for ovarian and breast cancer metastasis
Genetically engineered cancer cell lines to generate 8 stably transfected cell lines using RNA interference techniques.
Drug combination therapy analysis using different cytotoxicity assays
Designed and optimized cell metabolism analysis with extracellular flux analysis (seahorse).
Tumor suppressor and oncogene expression analysis using q RT-PCR and gene array.
Enzyme kinetic experiments to analyze catalase activity and hydrogen peroxide production.
Ovarian cancer migration and invasion analysis in in vitro and ex ovo models.
Multidisciplinary cancer research project coordination to study cancer metastasis in space with a pharmaceutical company and academic institutes.
Working as a project coordinator in a NIH/NCI funded tumor microenvironment and breast cancer metastasis project.
Optimized collection of metastatic cells from the human tumors grown in ex ovo models using an implantable micro fluidic device.
Working as a BSL2 lab manager and duties included organizing, maintaining lab instruments and training/mentoring students.
Presented scientific data at multiple conferences and contributed in manuscript writing and book chapter writing.

Graduate Research Associate, Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 2009-2013
Drug metabolism and DNA adduct analysis using LC/MS-MS.
Drug toxicity analysis in breast cancer cell lines using different cytotoxicity assays
Small molecule analysis with triple quadruple and iron trap mass spectrometers
Optimized methods for quantitative analysis of estrogen metabolism in biological samples before and after exposure to different drugs and botanical dietary supplements.
Successfully demonstrated that hops, a botanical dietary supplement used to alleviate postmenopausal symptoms, has breast cancer preventive properties.
Discovered that selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which have known estrogen receptor (ER) mediated breast cancer preventive mechanisms also have a novel ER independent mechanism of breast cancer prevention.
Contributed to several multidisciplinary projects leading to publication of 4 peer review articles and multiple talks and poster presentations.
