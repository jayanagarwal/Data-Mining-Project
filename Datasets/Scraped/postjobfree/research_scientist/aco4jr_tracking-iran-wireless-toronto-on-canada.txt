Objective: Placement in a challenging engineering position that allows for
research and development in topics such as digital signal processing (DSP)
and/or physical layer wireless communication systems.

Skill Highlights:

- Extensive industrial experience in LTE network design, base station
deployment and planning.

- Advance research experience in physical layer (PHY) of wireless
communication systems with the focus on Heterogeneous networks, Coordinated
multi-point networks, OFDM and MIMO systems.

- Professional expertise in digital signal processing (DSP), digital filter
design, equalization, target tracking (e.g. Kalman filtering), adaptive
filtering, estimation, detection and machine learning.

- Hands-on experience in modeling of wireless MIMO channels and development
of simulations in the field of telecommunications.

- Strong problem solving and analytical skills in linear algebra,
stochastic processes, Monte Carlo, nonlinear optimization, and Bayesian
statistics.

- Strong communication skills. For two consecutive years (2010 in Calgary
and 2011 in Niagara Falls), I served as the session chair for various
tracks in IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering
(CCECE).

- Professional programming skills in Matlab and C.
