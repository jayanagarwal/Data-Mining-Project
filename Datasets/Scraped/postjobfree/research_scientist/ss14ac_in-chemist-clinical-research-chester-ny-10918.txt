PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:
Pfizer (formerly Wyeth), Pearl River, NY
2001 - 2010
Principal Research Scientist
• Discovered, developed and demonstrated safe, economical and scalable processes for the synthesis, isolation and purification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs): actively participated as a research scientist on more than 20 projects supporting preclinical and clinical supplies.
• Prepared technical transfer packages and supported technology transfer to the Kilo Lab, Pilot Plant, and contract manufacturers in the preparation of GMP batches of API supporting clinical and commercial supplies. Included on-site participation and support, as well as trouble-shooting and collaborating with scale up facilities to resolve processing issues.
• 2009-2010: As a member of the Chiral Hydrogenation Team, developed second-generation processes using asymmetric hydrogenation catalysis, utilizing glove box techniques to work with air sensitive organometallic catalysts, high-throughput pressure-reactor screening, and application of catalysis knowledge. Recently discovered an unprecedented asymmetric hydrogenation of a highly-substituted quinolinium intermediate (manuscript in preparation).
• Executed processes in large scale lab reactors (5 to 50 Liter cylindrical reactors) to prepare 300-500 g batches of non-GMP API used in pre-clinical studies.
Occidental Chemical Corporation, Grand Island, NY
1998 - 2000
Senior Research Chemist
• Independently optimized a route to boratabenzene that was patented and executed on multi-kilogram scale.
• Discovered, developed and demonstrated safe, economical and scalable processes for the synthesis, isolation and purification of pharmaceutical intermediates.
The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH
1996 - 1998
Postdoctoral Research Associate (Prof. D. J. Hart)
• Investigated two synthetic approaches toward the synthesis of Manzamine A, marine alkaloid with extraordinary framework and functionality, to determine relative stereochemistry in the formed intermediates.
Indiana University Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN
1995 - 1996
Postdoctoral Research Associate (Prof. M. G. Organ)
• Developed tandem allyl silane addition (Sakurai reaction) with consecutive ring annulation methodology, and applied the technology to the synthesis of molecules of pentalene series.
• Investigated the asymmetric addition to carbonyl compounds utilizing lanthanide catalysts (prepared lanthanide catalysts from chiral organic ligands and lanthanide salts)
Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia
1988 - 1994
Research Scientist
• Developed methodology to selectively introduce sulfur-containing functional groups into isopreniods, including unprecedented in terpene series sulfonium salts preparation.
• Applied this technology to the synthesis of natural products (pheromones, fragrances, etc.).
• Demonstrated and elaborated a unique access toward tricyclic diterpenes of pimarane / rosane series.
