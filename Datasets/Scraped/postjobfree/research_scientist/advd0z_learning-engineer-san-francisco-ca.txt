Work Experience

Verily (Google) Life Sciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA
Machine Learning Engineer, January 2022 - Current
●Own On-wrist detection and heart rate estimation projects for the medical watch. Perform full ML cycle A-to-Z design, development, and deployment of algorithms and models in GCP for compliance report
●Design and develop machine learning models and algorithms for On-wrist detection in FW to achieve a 99% sensitivity and greater than 95% specificity
●Design and develop XGBoost models to perform sensor fusion for improving the cloud algorithm specificity (> 98%) compared to the FW implementation while maintaining the FW's high sensitivity
●Design, train, and evaluate deep temporal sensor fusion models to improve the MAPE metric of the heart rate estimation by 4-5 times compared to the previous signal processing-based algorithms
●Manage projects by collaborating with cross-functional teams (science, infra, and FW) and incorporate feedback obtained from meetings, crowd-sourced design doc writing, and software/results documentation
●Document results and software using clear and concise written communication
