PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE 

Principal Scientist: Dynavax Technologies, Berkeley, CA (January 2008-Date)

• Evaluate and select manufacturing contractors and suppliers.
• Manage and oversee contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) of non-GMP and cGPM oligonucleotides.
• Develop new oligonucleotides for preclinical and clinical studies.
• Prepare and review Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) technical reports and CMC section(s) of regulatory submissions from Phase 1 through Registration
• Play a key role guiding cross-functional teams, internal and external collaborations, provides expert opinion regarding development of new oligonucleotides to internal teams.
• Take an active role in development and discovery projects, serving as a mentor and resource to team members.
• Responsible for the GMP manufacturing of the oligonucleotide, which is the Immunostimulatory Sequence (ISS) for HEPLISAV™, that is a Phase 3 investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine. 
• Leading the development of branched oligonucleotide conjugate for a novel candidate drug for asthma. 
• Core team member of developing a vaccine intended for treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection.
• Managing the CMC activities on developing novel TLR inhibitors for diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. 
• Chemical Safety Office, providing resources and support for reducing potential chemical and environmental hazards.

Senior Research Associate: ThermoFisher Scientific-Milwaukee, WI (January 2002-January 2008) 
 
• Managed and preformed the oligonucleotide production. Implemented time and cost efficient strategies which lowered the cost of the oligonucleotide manufacturing.
• Reviewed, modified and created Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)s for custom and standard oligonucleotides production.
• Developed new methods for purification of oligonucleotides and specialty amidites.
• Coordinated order fulfillment activities across department functions as QC/QA and materials management.
• Evaluated and resolved customers complaints for Amidites and Oligonucleotides products.

Chemist: Pierce Milwaukee, WI (September 2000-December 2001)

• Design and work out synthetic routes of DNA and RNA Phosphordiamidite.
• Purification of nucleic acid compounds and oligonucleotide.
• Scale up organic compounds and key intermediates. 
• Transfer technologies to manufacture groups. 

Teaching Assistant, Graduate Research Assistant: Chemistry Department, Marquette University. Milwaukee, WI (June 1999-December 2004)

• Taught General Chemistry and Organic chemistry courses. 
• Developed a new four step route for the synthesis of oligosilanes pendant p-cyanostalbene chromophore. Synthesized a pentasilane precursor for use in the new route for pentasilanylsyanostilbene to investigate the photophysical properties and photoreactivity of intramolecular charge transfer excited states of oligsilanylarenes.
• Synthesized and studied of Keto Oxime esters as a photochemical "cage" compounds for photorelease of biomolecules, which are useful for photosensitized degradation of polystyrene, photoimaging systems and photoresists for printed circuit boards, and holography.

Technical Expert: Egyptian Fund for Technical Cooperation with Namibia. (January 1992- May 1997) 
 
• Planned and organized the assessment systems concerning technical and administrative aspects of teaching chemistry.
