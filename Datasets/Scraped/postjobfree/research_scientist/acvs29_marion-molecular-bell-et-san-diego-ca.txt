Post-doctoral Research Fellow September 2013 – May 2016 Elizabeth A. Komives, Ph.D., Laboratory, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA
Developed in vitro affinity purification and fluorescence anisotropy assays (thiol reactive Oregon Green 488 maleimide) to successfully quantify the dissociation rates of and rates of exchange between specific NFκB dimers with and without IκB proteins present (presented findings at two national conferences (See curriculum vitae) and three manuscripts are in preparation).
Developed and instituted the use of NFκB proteins (N-terminal cysteine constructs, p50/p50 constructs, and cRel/cRel constructs) and IκB proteins (IκBβ constructs and IκBε constructs) that have led to manuscripts in preparation.
Invited to and authored seven chapters in the Encyclopedia of Molecular Life Sciences, an 11-volume work commissioned by the NIH and published through a partnership between “Springer Sciences + Business Media” and the “American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.”
Used novel research projects to introduce high school students to and train undergraduate/graduate students and researchers in molecular biology (PCR, site-directed mutagenesis), protein expression and purification, and biophysical techniques (ITC, anisotropy, circular dichroism, size exclusion chromatography complexing, etc that led to manuscripts in preparation.
Graduate Student / Doctoral Candidate August 2008 – August 2013 Jessica K. Bell, Ph.D., Laboratory, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA
Biophysically characterized a previously discovered inhibitor of the type I interferon response and re-defined it as a novel substrate of TANK binding kinase 1 with multiple roles in the cell (Marion, J.D., et al., 2013).
Collaborated with numerous groups, both inside and outside of the institution, that resulted in presentations at national meetings (see CV) and publications (Mallory, K., et al., 2015, Van, D.N., et al., 2012, Luo, J., et al., 2012).
Awarded membership into two national honor societies (see CV), received a Phi Kappa Phi national scholarship, received multiple travel awards to national conferences (see CV), and awarded a Protein Society Young Investigator Award at the 27th annual national meeting (invited lecture) all in recognition of research excellence.
Used novel research projects to train graduate students and researchers in dsRNA synthesis, mammalian cell culture, immunoprecipitations, western blot analysis, radioactive kinase assays (ATP, [γ-32P]), protein expression and purification, and biophysical techniques (ITC, DSC DLS, mass spectrometry, etc the results of which led to presentations at national meetings (see CV) and publications (in preparation). Staff Scientist / Lab Manager June 2006 – July 2008 J. Ellis Bell, Ph.D., Laboratory, University of Richmond, Richmond, VA
Developed a novel technique to quantify changes in protein/protein or subunit/subunit interaction stability and strength as a consequence of ligand induced changes in quaternary structure (Marion, J.D., et al., 2010).
Developed protocols for and instituted the use of four instruments in the laboratory, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Omniflex), isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal iTC200), dynamic light scattering instrument (Wyatt Technology miniDAWN Tristar Laser Photometer with Quasi-Elastic Light Scattering attachment), and differential scanning calorimeter (MicroCal VP-DSC).
Developed protocols for and instituted the use of three techniques in the laboratory, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, limited proteolysis in combination with mass spectrometry, and the quantification of ligand induced changes of subunit/subunit interactions via a novel dynamic light scattering approach.
Used novel research projects to train undergraduate students in molecular biology (site-directed mutagenesis, etc protein expression and purification (E. coli expression system), and biophysical techniques (fluorescence, kinetics, calorimetry (ITC, DSC), mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, etc that led to presentations at national conferences (see CV) and publications (Bailey, J., Sinanan, L., et al., 2011, Wacker, S.A., et al., 2010).
