I am a highly experienced and capable research pharmacologist with over 15 years of experience. My research interests have mainly focused on the effects of investigational, pre-clinical and clinical drugs in a variety of in vitro and in vivo settings. I have supervised teams of students, postdoctoral fellows and technicians in pursuit of these projects. I am an able and effective communicator.

Scientific Experience:
Project Coordinator 2010-2011
Division of Cardiology, University of Washington School of Medicine
Investigated, with a group of technicians and faculty, cardiac and renal functions in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.

Assistant Professor (Acting) 2008-2010
Dept. of Pathology, University of Washington School of Medicine
• Investigating the effect of a novel PPAR-α agonist on the development of kidney disease in a newly characterized mouse model of diabetic nephropathy
• Explored the effect of MK 886, an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase activity on adiposity and atherosclerosis in a diet-induced model of type II diabetes
• Investigated the role of fatty acids on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in immortalized mesangial cells
• Promoted and engaged in multiple collaborative projects

Instructor (Acting) 2004-2008
Dept. of Pathology, University of Washington School of Medicine
• Investigated the pharmacodynamic effects of thiazolidinediones and fatty acid analogues on fatty acid- processing enzymes.
• Provided laboratory guidance, troubleshooting skills and mentored provided guidance to a group of 10 graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral fellows and research staff

Research Associate 2003-2004
Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Washington School of Medicine
• Studied the biophysics of lipid membranes in macrophages

Senior Fellow
Dept. of Pathology, University of Washington School of Medicine 2000-2003
• Initiated studies centering on the effects of fatty acids on phosphoprotein signaling in primary cell cultures of vascular cells.
• Developed tools for researching cellular lipids homeostasis
• Identified and promoted academic collaborations

Graduate Student/Research Associate 1992-2000
Dept. of Pharmacology, New York Medical College
• Analyzed the effect of a novel thromboxane receptor antagonist (BMS180291) on salt and water balance in an ex vivo model of renal function (isolated, perfused kidney).
• Investigated the role of eicosanoids, inflammatory cytokines and the renin-angiotensin system in rat models of hypertension (i.e aortic coarctation, angiotensin II-infusion, 5/6 nephectomy, uninephectomy).
• Provided guidance and tutorial sessions for medical students in the area of cardiovascular pharmacology
