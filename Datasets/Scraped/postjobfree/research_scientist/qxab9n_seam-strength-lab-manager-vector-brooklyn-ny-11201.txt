EXPERIENCE
Anzenna Inc., Brooklyn, NY 06/10 – till date
Scientist, Research and Development
• Designed and optimized multiple test strategies for label-free detection of cancer biomarkers.
• Developed sample preparation and validation assays for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrheae including DNA extraction/purification, amplification and quantitation.
• Developed and optimized protein formulations for pH, ionic strength and temperature of the buffer solutions.
• Analyzed and designed microfluidic system with different design specifications and fabrication methods to efficiently deliver the sample to the sensing surface of the biosensor device.
• Gained perspective in management, product development, deal structures and market segmentation.
• Wrote and submitted weekly technical reports and SOPs.

Organic Electronics Lab, NYU Poly- Brooklyn, NY 06/06 – 06/11
Research Assistant
• Optimized the design and test setup for detection of protein and DNA binding on a next generation diagnostic platform consisting of Floating Gate Field Effect Transistors.
• Developed a solid-state conducting polymer based ion-selective electrode for trace analysis of dissolved inorganic ions in clinical samples with high concentrations of contaminating proteins.
• Studied protein binding on polyaniline membranes doped with different counter-ions which led to the optimization for its use in the development of ion selective electrodes for immunosensing applications.
• Developed an indium tin oxide based biosensor for detection of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis spores.

Abo Akademi- Turku, Finland 09/09 – 12/09
Visiting Researcher [FiDiPro(Finland distinguished professor program]
• Collaborated with Turku University Hospital (Tyks) for the development of a point-of-care device for rapid label-free detection of C-reactive protein in clinical samples.
• Led a collaboration to investigate the effect of thiolation on polyaniline membranes for DNA immobilization using analytical chemistry methods like EIS, UV-Vis and amperometry.

Tissue Engineering lab, Polytechnic University- Brooklyn, NY 01/04 – 06/06
Graduate Assistant (Lab Manager)
