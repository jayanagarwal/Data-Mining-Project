Research Scientist and Project Design Coordinator

Technique Development: Developed innovative technique using in vivo fluorescent imaging for quantifying viral clearance in a mouse model of hepatitis.

Project Design: Designed a detailed scientific research project from ground up including technique troubleshooting and results interpretation.

Regulatory Compliance: Responsible for IACUC compliance with small animals as well as radiation and biohazard safety adherence.

Technically Proficient: Frequent exposure to new technique-specific software as well as regular use of MS Office.

Research Interests: The role of TNF superfamily members in T cell-mediated clearance of viral infection in the liver using a mouse model of hepatitis and in vivo fluorescence imaging.
