After completion of my first internship I was invited to join a second internship with NASA. Students were selected from across the nation to participate in this opportunity through a competitive process. We were put into teams on a mission concept assignment for Mars. My job description was power supply for the mission. We had a budget to stick with and completed a variety of assignments that financed our budget.
