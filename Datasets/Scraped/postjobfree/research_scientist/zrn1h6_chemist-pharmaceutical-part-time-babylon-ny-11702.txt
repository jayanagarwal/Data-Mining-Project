Summary:
Seeking a PhD level position where I can make an impact as a member of a project team.

I am a highly motivated, team-oriented and goal-driven medicinal chemist with significant experience in pharmaceutical small molecule drug discovery. As a member of several multi-disciplinary project teams, I have made important contributions to the discovery of multiple clinical candidates. I have established a reputation as a self-starter, who performs well under pressure, thrives in a fast-paced environment and adapts well to new situations.

Demonstrated areas of knowledge and expertise:
• Track record of being a key project team member on multiple programs leading to clinical candidates such as OSI-906 (IGF-IR, phase III) and OSI-027 (mTOR, phase I)
• Experienced with multi-step organic synthesis from mg to kg scale and high speed analoging (HSA) chemistry techniques
• Experienced in medicinal chemistry with a strong background in interpreting structure-activity relationships and optimizing compounds to improve potency, in vitro, and in vivo ADME properties
• Chemistry project leader for two hit to lead exploratory programs
• Supervisor of full-time associate staff, inventory temp., and summer interns
• Experience in multiple protein classes including GPCRs and protein kinases
• 7 publications and 8 patents
• Pioneered the development and the training of electronic notebooks and chemical inventory systems within the chemistry department
