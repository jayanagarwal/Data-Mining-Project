Ark of Inquiry EU Project – Humboldt University 2015-2016

Research assistant

The Ark of Inquiry is a project the spanned over 12 European countries with the goal of aims to raise awareness of pupils to Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) by promoting an interest in science through inquiry learning. I was in charge of leading the country of Germany's contributions to the project's goals on the European scale.

Master’s Thesis 2014

Masters project entitled (Synthesis of Non Canonical Amino Acids for the Investigation of Protein Expression in Automated Settings). During this project, I also utilized different analytical techniques such as: HPLC, LC MS, 1D 2D NMR Spectroscopy. In this project I worked with several organic synthesis techniques, purification and protein synthesizers. I worked independently to design new synthetic routes to reach the desired chemical product (trans 4 fluoroproline). Also, I performed various cell growth techniques along with protein expression.

Internships: 2011-2012
