Professor: Andrea J. Tenner
Dissertation: “Characterization of Structural Parameters Critical for C1qRP”. Identification and functional characterization of the membrane receptor for C1q, the first component of the complement cascade. Demonstrated the role of functional C1qRP, the C1q receptor that enhances phagocytosis, characterization of C1qRP enhancement of phagocytosis by freshly purified human monocytes and macrophage cell lines, analysis of regulation of expression of C1qRP, characterization of glycosylation of C1qRP and the role of glycosylation in C1qRP cell surface stabilization, generated mutant constructs of C1qRP for bacterial and eukaryotic protein expression and purification.

Graduate Student, Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, Master’s
Professor: Gale A. Granger
Thesis: “The Role of TNF-Receptor-Releasing Enzyme and Soluble TNF Receptors in the Regulation of TNF Activity”. Developed an assay to detect and quantitate the activity of the TNF receptor releasing enzyme (TRRE), the metallo-protease involved in the generation of soluble TNF receptors, and characterization of its role in the regulation of TNF activity.

Veterans Hospital of West Los Angeles, CA
September 1990-1992
Research Assistant, Endocrinology Lab
Research project: Investigated the mechanism of action of TNF-a on thyroid cells in culture, characterized the effects of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and TNF-a on rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells by quantitation of various mRNA species and activation of NF-kB by EMSA.
