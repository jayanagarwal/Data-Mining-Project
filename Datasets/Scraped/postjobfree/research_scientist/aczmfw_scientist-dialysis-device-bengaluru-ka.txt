Career Summary
In my career spanning 24 years, I have been versatile, having successfully mastered various IT as well as R& D technologies. I have taken up diverse roles of a software designer, developer, technical lead, project manager, technical architect, technical consultant, integration specialist, inventor as well as research scientist. I have worked with mainframes, mid range systems, client server systems as well as embedded technologies. I have gained considerable experience and success in leading Centre of Excellence (CoE) teams to build expertise in niche and emerging technologies. I have had the experience of working with MNCs in the US, Europe and the middle-east. In every role, I have excelled and have been always exceeded expectations of my employers and our clients.
My core skill has been my ability to quickly grasp any technology that I have come across. I am a quick learner and have been very eager to learn and apply myself across all disciplines of science and engineering. The patents that I have filed for my inventions, validate my ability to apply myself to any problem thrown at me
My decision to quit IT and move to R&D shows my passion towards technology and the confidence I have in myself to re-skilling in any technology or domain
Working with startups in the R&D space has helped me understand the great challenges of taking a product from a working prototyping to a commercially viable product Career Goals
Though I have considerable experience in the IT Industry, I have spent about 6 years re- skilling myself in technologies related to R&D – Mechatronics/Embedded/Medical Technologies
Aim is to establish myself in the R&D space as an Inventor/Scientist/Researcher/Developer/Social Entrepreneur of new patentable ideas/products by integrating electronics/mechanics/bio-medical and embedded technologies and to gain experience in building, realizing and commercializing products
Long term goal is build expertise in the “rehabilitation engineering” and Robotics/Bionics/BioMechatronics/Medical Electronics domain and to use this experience to develop lost cost effective solutions (Assistive Technologies) for people with disabilities and also other medical conditions that could benefit from breakthrough innovations. Also in the near future, wish to pursue a PhD in Robotics/Bionics

ÿ The feeding cycle involved the spoon going to a bowl and scooping the food and bringing it to the mouth of the diner ÿ The feeder has installed with IR sensors to ensure that the user was not harmed if his/her body part came in the path of the feeder while it was in operation
ÿ Another switch was provided to stop and start the feeding cycle at any point of the feeding cycle, by the user
ÿ The feeding bowl was mounted on a rotating table, so that food could be scooped up from all areas as it rotated
ÿ The robotic feeder could automatically detect the homing position and could come to the original position when switched on Contribution ÿ Independently designed and developed every aspect of the robotic feeder which included
- Designing and developing the gear and gear boxes for the robotic arm
- Designed the Electronic schematics for the board design using ExpressSch
- Designed the PCB Layout using the ExpressPCB software
