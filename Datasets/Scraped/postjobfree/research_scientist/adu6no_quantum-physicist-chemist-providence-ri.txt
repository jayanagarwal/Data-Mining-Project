WORK EXPERIENCE

Computational Physicist (Condensed Matter Physics, Postdoctoral), Brown University, Providence, RI 2020-22
- Implemented and benchmarked a Quantum Monte-Carlo simulations code for flat-band topological materials of different 1D and 2D structures described by Hubbard model. Developed the code to a multi-determinant wavefunction expansion for strongly-correlated systems at finite temperature and excited state.

General Manager (B2B business: consultancy, sales, executing), SPG Trading GmbH, Hamburg, Germany 2018-19

Computational Material Scientist (Postdoctoral Researcher), University of Twente, Netherlands 2016-18
- Quantum mechanical scattering (ab-initio, first principles) calculations and data analysis of spin-polarized current and spin transport parameters (spin-flip diffusion length, spin-Hall angle, etc.) in transition metals by a Density- Functional-based scattering code (STUTTGART TB-LMTO), verifying the generality of the Elliot-Yafet mechanism for doped semiconductors and alkali elements and establishing numerical benchmarks for experiment. The results were published in Phys. Rev. Lett.

Computational Physicist (Research Assistant, condensed matter physics), IPC-PAC, Warsaw, Poland 2014-15
- Investigating spin relaxation in magnetic nanostructures within the quantum-mechanical approach and tight-binding model of electronic structure, derived a novel formula and developed FORTRAN code for magnetization dynamics in such thin films, and prepared draft for publication, led to 3 first-author publications.
