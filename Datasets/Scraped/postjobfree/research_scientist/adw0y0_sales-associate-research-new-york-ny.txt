Dear Sir or Madam:
I am writing to express my interest in a career with your firm in Environmental Science or Renewable Energy. I recently obtained my Bachelor’s Degree in Environmental studies with a concentration in Environmental Law and Policy from Stony Brook University. I was a Dean’s list recipient at Suffolk County Community College where I received my Associates Degree in Business Administration.
Throughout college I obtained much knowledge in the field of Environmental Science and Law by taking numerous courses in Marine Microbiology, Biology, Physiology, and Environmental Physics.
Besides the knowledge I have learned from these courses, I also have been involved in several rigorous internships that have afforded me the opportunity to widen my scope of knowledge. Many of these internships allowed me to learn local environmental laws and how they have affected the environment.
I welcome the opportunity to meet with you at your convenience to further discuss my skills and qualifications. I can be reached at 631-***-**** or by email at: adw0y0@r.postjobfree.com.

Sincerely,

Bryan Galvez
