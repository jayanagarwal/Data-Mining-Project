Performance of Malware Classification with Machine Learning using Feature Selection
• The project aimed to classify malware families using feature selection and machine learning algorithms.
• Build a malware family classifier with 82 percent accuracy from the frequency of API calls(limited first 100 API calls ) using ML pipelines
• Tools Used: Python
• Machine Learning Algorithms: MLP, Random Forest, and SVM with linear, RBF, and polynomial kernel
• Feature Selection: FDR-ANOVA, RFE, LASSO, FDR-Chi2 ACADEMIC PROJECTS
Heart Disease Diagnosis using machine learning algorithm:
• Time Complexity Analysis of ML pipeline using heart diagnosis data set: In terms of time complexity, Logistic Regression performed best in of area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and SVM took the most time in the training phase.
Tools used: Python
Machine Learning Algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine
Toxic Comment Challenges:
• Predict the probability of toxicity from multi-class comments of 56.32 MB Wikipedia comments using two regression models where Logistic Regression performs the best in terms of AUC-ROC and accuracy Tools used: Python
Machine Learning Algorithms: Random forest, Logistic Regression AWARDS AND CERTIFICATIONS
