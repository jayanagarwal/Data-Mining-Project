I am currently an assistant professor of Biology at Limestone University in South Carolina teaching
undergraduate Biology curriculum. My other appointments are more research-based and include Research Professor in the Pharmaceutical Science Department at Northeastern University in Boston to continue my cannabinoid research, and as a Research Scientist at The University of Connecticut in Storrs CT, where I received my PhD in 2008 working in the department of Pharmaceutical Sciences/Toxicology and Neuroscience Program.
I previously taught from 2011-2016 as affiliated faculty in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the University of Hartford after completing postdoctoral fellowships at the Harvard Medical School in Boston studying non-human primate age-related brain pathology, and at UConn to do work focusing on whether gene expression changes were induced with drug treatment conducted for my thesis. I feel that my qualifications are an excellent match for the opportunity in your program. I am free to discuss the particulars to determine if this is a good fit for both of us. David Butler, Ph.D.
