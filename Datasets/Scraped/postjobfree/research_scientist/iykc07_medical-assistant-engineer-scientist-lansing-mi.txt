PATENT
Zeng W and He SY. Compositions and methods for conversion of aldehydes to alkanes, US patent application 201******** (http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2010/0251428.html). This patent is based on my work on the SCD2 gene. It demonstrates a novel method to identify mutant plants with altered epicuticular wax compositions, and offers a possibility to engineer the production of alkanes using microbes or plants.
