Research Experience

Research Volunteer: UCSF (Jan 2013-present)
Dr. McNamara laboratory, Department of Francis I Proctor Foundation, UCSF.
Project: Autoimmune model of dry eye disease
Description: Immunohistochemistry analysis and studying Gene expression profile of
Glyco-gene chip array in control, AIRE knockout an d AIRE/IL1 double knockout mice,
Sectioning of OCT eye tissues, Cytospin, Western blot and genotyping of mice tail
lysates.

Predoctoral Fellow: AMRF (Jan–Nov 2010)
Department of Genetics, Aravind Medical Research Foundation, Madurai.
Project: Association studies on Glaucoma
Description: Case-control analysis was performed to investigate the association of 5
SNPs on chromosome 2p using 220 unrelated POAG cases and 220 age-matched
unaffected controls. Among the five SNPs screened, SNPs rs10202118 and rs11125375
showed significant association with POAG. This was the first study to demonstrate the
association of SNPs on chromosome 2p in patients with POAG in the Indian population.
The results were published in IOVS 2012.

Predoctoral Fellow: NEI/NIH (2007 – 2008)
Dr. Fielding Hejtmancik laboratory, Ophthalmic Genetics NEI/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.
Project: Association studies on diabetic retinopath y(DR) and Linkage analysis of cataract
Description: Investigated the association of 23 polymorphisms in 12 candidate genes,
using more than 700 DNA samples of DR and DNR by DNA sequencing and different
genotyping techniques. Among these, one SNP rs2070600 in RAGE showed statistically
significant association with DR. The results were published in BMC Medical Genetics
2010. Performed linkage analysis of cataract using panel of microsatellite markers. LOD
score > 2.5 – 3 was used to identify the linkage between chromosome loci and the
disease. The markers in chromosome 1 and 3 were showing > 2 LOD score.

Senior Research Fellow: CSIR, AMRF, Madurai (2008 – 2009)
Project: Association studies on diabetic retinopathy
Description: Continued the same association studies performed at NIH.

Junior Research Fellow: AMRF, Madurai. (2003 – 2007)
Project: Molecular genetics of DR and Mutation screening of JXLR and FEVR
Description: The objective of this study was to examine the genetic variations of the
VEGF and eNOS gene and assess their possible relationship to DR in 210 type 2 diabetic
patients of DR and DNR. Three SNPs in VEGF, C(-7)T, T(-1498)C, and C(-634)G were
statistically significant in the DR group when compared wi th DNR group. This was the
first study to show the association of VEGF polymorphisms with DR in Indian population.
The results were published in Molecular vision 2006, which got cited by 90. Performed
mutation screening of JXLR and FEVR as well. Published two papers for JXLR in both
Molecular vision 2007 and American Journal of Ophthalmology 2007.
