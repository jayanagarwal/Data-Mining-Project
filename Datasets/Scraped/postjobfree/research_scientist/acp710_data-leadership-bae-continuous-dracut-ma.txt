§ Competent with the following programming languages:
• Java, C++, Matlab, AMPL, CPLEX, SQL, BASH Scripting, Python, R

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Senior Research Scientist Nov 2014 - Present
Boston Fusion Corporation
§ Working on DARPA projects involving cyber security and resilient computing
§ Principal Investigator for a project that is investigating the use of dynamic policy engine to detect, fight
through and recover from unknown cyber attacks
§ Developing the framework for the project from scratch
§ Developed a test environment using SNORT and Metasploit to jump start the generation of ideas for what
the I/O would be for the software begin developed
§ Investigated applications to SCADA, ICS and IT in both the DoD and Civilian platforms

Senior Research Engineer / Field Engineering Site Lead Feb 2011 – Nov 2014
BAE Systems Inc.
§ Working on DARPA projects involving data analytics and algorithm development for data fusion
technologies
§ Integrated software developed for cutting edge radar platform data fusion
§ Lead a team of three engineers in developing tools for data collection during ISR missions that will help to
standardize data collected as well as alert the user to possible impending system issues in real time. This

software is now in the process of being integrated into the next major software release for the deployed
system
§ Trained new operators and technicians on troubleshooting radar software to ensure that users are capable of
maintaining and operating the system
§ Lead a team of engineers to developed data visualization tools to help engineers temporally correlate events
that were happening at the time of a system error
§ Developed a mission summary tool to help organize and standardize the collection of data that could then
be used to help improve radar performance
§ Used text mining techniques to group mission data based on errors that were recorded during missions to
help feed the engineering pipeline for continuous improvement efforts
§ Developed adaptable test metrics for tracking and fusion data that have been adapted by BAE as the
standard for measures of performance for current and future technologies
§ Lead a team of analysts in field-testing a deployed radar system. Mission operational downtime was
decreased to less than 3% through troubleshooting techniques, scripting and proper training of analysts
using manuals and checklist I developed in the field
§ As field system administrator for Windows and UNIX based systems I maintained the information
assurance standards for our systems to ensure that we were compliant for connection to SIPRNET

Systems Engineer Jul 2009 – Feb 2011
Raytheon Company
§ Developed Matlab programs to efficiently automate data analysis of large radar data sets which decreased
data analysis of radar track data from days to hours and allowed for continuous analysis of data as it was
being received in a continuous stream
§ Worked with a team of engineers on system integration and verification requirements for the most recent
software build for radar systems. Refined requirements and developed testing to ensure that requirements
were being met
§ Worked with a team of software and systems engineers to determine an optimal backup and compression
schedule for our Monte Carlo server to reduce lag time during peak usage. This led to further study and
eventually to the implementation of a backup schedule to ensure that server space was maintained at an
acceptable level

Student Researcher (Study Abroad Program) Winter 2008
Sustaining Mountain Ecosystems in the Western Ghats, India
§ Conducted research on the effects of ecotourism on the ecosystems in India and Belize as they relate to the
local environment and the native population
§ Looked at how Belize and India could learn from each other through collaboration
§ Developed continued collaboration with the Foundation for Research in Sustainable Development to
expand the study and produce a book on native species of butterflies
