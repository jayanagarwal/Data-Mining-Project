Summary of my dissertation work of M.Pharm. III Sem. Project

Formulation of Extended Release Tablet Dosage forms of Verapamil Hydrochloride: Drug Release Optimization using Central Composite Design (CCD).

Compressed hydrophilic matrices constitute one of the most popular approaches for designing oral sustained release dosage forms. These possess distinct advantages of reproducibility in release profile, avoidance of dose dumping and straight forward manufacturing process. Release characteristics of compressed matrices have frequently been optimized using CCD to embark upon the preeminent formulation, thus saving a great deal of time, money and professional expertise.
A CCD for 2 factors, taking HPMC K4M and Sodium CMC (low viscosity), was adopted for optimization with factor levels suitably coded. Preliminary studies were conducted to investigate 3 levels of release retarding polymers. Nine randomized tablet batches for each combination were prepared by dry granulation. Amounts of microcrystalline cellulose and lubricants were kept constant, while diluents was used in quantity sufficient to maintain constant tablet weight. Tablets from each batch were monitored for the physical performance, drug content and dissolution, and data processed using ZOREL software. Diffusional release exponent (n) and MDT were determined, the type of release predicted and the values of t50%, t60%, t70% and t80% computed by Steinman interpolation. Response variables were n, t60%, MDT and the amount released in 12h (rel12h). Polynomial equations were obtained by Davies method using FACTOP software and 3D and contour response surfaces were drawn. Finally, optimum formulations were chosen as checkpoints by feasibility and grid searches, tablets formulated accordingly, evaluated for release performance and compared with predicted responses.
The HPMC-CMC combination was found to be useful in drug release regulation till 12h. Values of MDT and t60% augment, while rel12h values decrease with increasing concentrations of HPMC in almost linear fashion. However, “n” values diminished in a nonlinear manner with HPMC.
For CMC fraction, a milder linear trend with plateau results, suggesting negligible influence of low viscosity polymer at higher concentration. High degree of prognosis was discerned indicating successful use of CCD in formulating optimized matrices
