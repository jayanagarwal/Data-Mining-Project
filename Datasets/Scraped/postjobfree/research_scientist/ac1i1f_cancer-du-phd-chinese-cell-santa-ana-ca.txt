1. My research and achievements in cancer metabolism based cancer chemotherapeutics. Cancer cell demands huge extracellular nutrient uptake via nutrient transporters located in cell membrane to satisfy its hyperactive anabolism and uncontrolled proliferation, which makes cancer metabolism a promising target for typical cancer therapeutics. FTY720, a sphingolipid-based drug, can trigger loss of nutrient transporters on cell membrane, and selectively starve cancer cells, but causes a decrease in heart rate.
My projects are designed to evaluate novel FTY720 analogues that wipe off the toxicity but retain both the effects on transporters and the excellent pharmacologic properties of FTY720, and to elucidate the mechanism(s) of how FTY720 and its analogues induce transporters withdrawal from cell membrane. While several derivatives of FTY720 are found to have the ability to selectively starve cancer cells, my work has revealed that PP2A is involved in FTY720 and its analogues induced nutrient transporter loss. 2. My findings in research of cancer metabolism targeted cancer therapeutics. My research indicated that loss of TSC2 confers resistance to ceramide and nutrient deprivation. In low amino acid and glucose medium, and following ceramide-induced nutrient transporter loss, elevated mTORC1 activity significantly enhanced the adaptive upregulation of new transporter proteins for amino acids and glucose. And the introduction of oncogenic Ras abrogated the survival advantage of TSC2 / MEFs upon ceramide treatment most likely by increasing nutrient demand. These results suggest that, in the absence of oncogene-driven biosynthetic demand, mTORC1-dependent translation facilitates the adaptive cellular response to nutrient stress. 3. My achievements in cancer stem cell research.
Latest research demonstrates that, except residue of cancer cells that survive cancer treatment, it can also be cancer stem cells that initiate cancer recurrence in patients, leading to cancer treatment failure. Resume of Gang Liu, PhD 2017

Therefore it is crucial to elucidate the mechanism of cancer stem cell development and find the markers that will identify cancer stem cell. My major contributions to this area are exemplified as below: 1) My study implicated MAT1 in hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and leukemia progression. My results suggested that MAT1 overexpression resisted intrinsic MAT1 fragmentation to sustain hematopoietic CD34+ cell expansion while preventing granulopoiesis, suggesting that the intrinsically programmed MAT1 expression and fragmentation regulate granulopoiesis by inversely coordinating CAK and TFIIH activities.
2) My findings unveiled KLF4’s role in cancer initiation. My study showed that active KLF4 resulted in increased gastrointestinal tract stem cells, and tumor repressors weakened KLF4- mediated activation of cell proliferation. This original finding identified KLF4’s role in both cancer initiation and tissue stem cell potential maintenance. 3) My work contributed to identification of osteosarcoma cancer stem cells. My findings identified that the CD49f CD133+ subpopulation were enriched in osteosarcoma cancer stem cells that are responsible for osteosarcoma initiation. My contributions provided the opportunity for development of osteosarcoma cancer stem cells-targeted therapy aimed at osteosarcoma eradication.
4) My research identified 2 metastasis-associated genes. Cancer stem cells have strong potential of initiating cancer cell invasion and metastasis. I identified 2 novel genes, mag-1 and mag-2, whose functions were closely associated with cancer invasion and metastasis phenotypes. My contributions to this research helped shed on mechanism underlying tumor metastasis. 4. My achievements in leukemia research.
Leukemia treatment through transplantation is always badly frustrated by the shortage of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) existing in graft transplanted into leukemia patients and the graft-versus- host disease (GVHD) resulting from graft attacking recipient’s tissues. Results of my projects aimed to solve the problems showed that HSCs, with the support of bone marrow stromal cells, were extensively expanded while the multi-potent, naive HSCs were maintained. My further research indicated that, for the first time, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play similar roles as stromal cells in supporting HSCs expansion, and that MSCs unexpectedly inhibit lymphocyte differentiation from HSCs.
