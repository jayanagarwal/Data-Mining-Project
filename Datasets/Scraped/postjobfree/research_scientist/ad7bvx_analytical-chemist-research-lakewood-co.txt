Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope you find the diversity of my background to be a fit for this role. I hold bachelorâ€™s degrees in biology and psychology, and a minor in chemistry. I began my laboratory career analyzing environmental samples in an inorganic chemistry laboratory. Then I moved to an organic chemistry laboratory analyzing environmental samples from various sources including drinking water, ground water, wastewater, and soil. My most recent laboratory experience was in research in assay development. Not only did I complete bench work in these roles, but I also had the opportunity to oversee the work of interns and other team members in some roles.

Beyond the laboratory, I have experience in construction and truck driving. I love to work with my hands. You will find that I am hard-working, a self-starter, and very willing to learn. Thank you for your consideration.
