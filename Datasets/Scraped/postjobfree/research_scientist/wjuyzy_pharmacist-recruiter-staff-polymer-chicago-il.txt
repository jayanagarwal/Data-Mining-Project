RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Post-Doctoral Fellowship, Northwestern University
John Kessler (M.D.), Director - Feinberg Neuroscience Institute & Prof. - Dept of Neurology 2008-2010
Samuel Stupp (Ph. D.), Prof. – Depts. of Materials Science, Chemistry, & Medicine & Director – Institute of
Bionanotechnology in Medicine (IBNAM)
Topic: Structural/biophysical characterization of hydrogel-forming self-assembling peptide amphiphile systems
utilized for specific regeneration of the nervous, cardiovascular, integumentary, and skeletal systems.
Assessing structure-function relationships of hydrogels consisting of peptide amphiphile molecules of different
chemical sequences and biological targets. Procedure development for quality control of co-assembled nanostructures
Results: Solvents used to solubilize peptide amphiphiles (either or organic or aqueous) induce different oligomerization
states depending on their chemical properties and the sequence of the peptide amphiphile. Non-aqueous and highly
polar organics are successful in monomerizing multiple peptide amphiphiles, even those with highly hydrophobic
character. Solubilization was characterized using spectroscopic techniques including X-ray scattering. Solid-state
NMR was also introduced as a technique to quantitate co-assembly and molecular spacing in peptide amphiphile
hydrogels. With the methodology produced, lab members can effectively control the concentration of bioactive
signals in their molecular hydrogels by varying the concentrations of each peptide amphiphile molecule.
Collaborations: Joseph Orgel (Ph.D), Assistant Professor of Biology at Illinois Institute of Technology and Associate
Director of Fiber Crystallography Biophysics Collaborative Access Team (BIOCAT), Argonne National Lab
Advanced Photon Source, Yoshitaka Ishii (Ph.D), Associate Professor, Department of Chemistry, University
of Illinois at Chicago, Stephen Weigand (Ph.D), DND-CAT, Argonne National Lab Advanced Photon Source

Graduate Thesis Education, The University of Chicago
Stephen Meredith Lab (M.D/Ph.D.), Prof - Dept. of Pathology and Biochemistry/Molecular Biology 2003-2008
Topic: Characterization of peptide models of Huntington’s Disease, exploration of sequence elements
essential for fibril formation and aggregation using in vitro biophysical techniques and spectroscopies,
determination of natural hungtintin protein sequences involved with inhibition of aggregation processes
Results: Flanking polyproline sequences of the huntingtin protein can act as natural inhibitors of polyglutamine
fibril formation, structural evidence of the threshold phenomenon seen in this disease were shown with
correlations to in vivo aggregate morphology and toxicity
Collaborations: Argonne National Lab Advanced Photon Source for X-ray diffraction, Joseph Orgel (Ph.D),
Assistant Professor of Biology at Illinois Institute of Technology

University of Chicago Structural Biology Workshop, (3 months), The University of Chicago 2004
Topic: One of three students chosen to take part in the first joint training workshop between Argonne and UofC
whose purpose was to provide structural characterization of previously unknown proteins found by Argonne’s
high-throughput project
Results: Effective cloning and expression of a ubiquitously-labeled (13C and 15N) uncharacterized protein from the
human genome, NMR-HSQC spectra collection and initial residue assignment of this entire protein
Collaborations: Argonne National Lab Structural Biology Center, University of Chicago Biomolecular
NMR Facility

Lab Rotation, (3 months), The University of Chicago 2002
Shohei Koide Lab (Ph.D.), Prof. – Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Topic: Bisection of a beta-sheet rich protein, type III domain of human fibronectin, as a model system for beta-sheet complementation and folding, use of yeast-two hybrid constructs to identify mutations that increase fragment affinity
in solution and cause increased stability, molecular biology techniques to create plasmid constructs, Western Blot and immunoblot analysis to confirm protein expression
Results: Use of a yeast two-hybrid system with immunoglobulin-like beta-sheet proteins can identify stabilizing
Mutations. This is novel because other assays use typical outputs such as function, binding to targets, susceptibility
to proteolysis, thermal stability, or resistance to redox potentials, whereas this system results in gene expression
Main Role: Construction, cloning, and expression of six bisected yeast-two hybrid models

Undergraduate Research Experiences
Linda Parysek Lab (Ph.D.), Dept. of Neuroscience, University of Cincinnati 2001
Topic: Understanding nerve regeneration after injury and the role of peripherin in this process

protein in murine spinal cord neurons at various stages of differentiation

Eva Csuhai (Ph.D.), Dept. of Chemistry, Transylvania University 2000
Topic and Role: Spermine biogenesis, initial cloning of the polyamine using a viral vector system with subsequent
expression. Provided materials for use on the biochemical and kinetic analysis of N-arginine dibasic convertase
enzyme, which is responsible for cleaving between Arg-Arg and Arg-Lys residues
