To the attention of:
Manju for Idexcel,
703-***-****
San Diego, CA 92121.

I am writing you today to submit my resume for the Scientist 1 position available as
posted on Postjobfree.com.

For the qualification requirements, I have completed a bachelor’s degree in
biochemistry and a master’s degree in pharmacology. I have a five years’ experience in
academic research as a lab assistant as well as a six months experience in a non -
traditional drug-discovery environment and one year experience in food processing
quality control.

On the technical level, I have a good experience in molecular and cellular biology wit h
very strong skills in instrumentation and computers. Through my education and work
experiences, I have acquired a solid understanding of scientific principles and technical
laboratory skills. I have on many occasions made proof of concept experiments, write,
troubleshoot and implement protocols as well as train coworkers. My curiosity and my
critical analysis skills make me a detail-oriented fast learner. I am in fact strongly
motivated by innovation and learning experiences. I have good organization skills and I
know the importance of a detailed notebook. In that matter, I have put in place the
central data and backup system of my research group. I also have a strong interpersonal
skills as well as good communication skills proven in the publication s and
communications sections on my resume.

My previous work experiences have put me in a situation where I have su ccessfully
completed similar tasks and responsibilities stated in the job offer. I recently decided for
my career to relocate in a major biotechnological center like San Diego where I already
have a social network. I think that this scientist position would offer me that chance of
career development while contributing to the success of company and open new
possibilities. I will require a work visa sponsorship, but I will put every effort necessary
to help that process.

I hope that my application has caught your attention and that we will further discuss of
it in the future. I am also available for other opportunities that would suit my profile.

Best regards,

Yannick Miron M.Sc.
