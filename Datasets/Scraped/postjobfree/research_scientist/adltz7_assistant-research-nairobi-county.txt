Thesis Title: FACTORS INFLUENCING FRESH WATER AVAILABILITY IN KIBAONI, KILIFI COUNTY, KENYA
Summary: This project assessed the impacts of water supply in Kibaoni area, in Kilifi with a main objective of finding the most accessible water supply in terms of quality, quantity and cost among the existing water supply options. With water scarcity problem growing worse as the world population grows. Lack of clean drinking water to households has already had a significant effect on international development. Seawater desalination has been seen as a long-term freshwater source. To determine water quality samples were analyzed through chemical and biological analysis to determine general Coliform and E.coli counts against the respectively the specified nil.
