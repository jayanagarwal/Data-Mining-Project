Title of thesis: Ameliorating effect of quercetin loaded poly(d,l-lactide) nanoparticles
against coal fly ash nanoparticles-induced toxicity
The source, generation, characterization and the toxicity of ambient particulate matter is an active area of research. There are only few in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted on the toxicity of coal fly ash (CFA) particles. This area requires further extensive examination, since earlier studies have not adequately considered the CFA particle characteristics and mechanistic aspect of the CFA-induced toxicity, in the in vitro and in vivo models. Due to its extensive production and wider application there is a heavy discharge of coal fly ash nanoparticles (CFA-NPs) into the atmosphere and it is a potential risk to living organisms. There is a growing interest in the toxicity of CFA-NPs and their significance in relation to human health. It is already known from the previous literatures that the exposure to particulate matter leads to severe adverse effects. This interest encouraged us to investigate the toxicity response using in vitro and in vivo models for understanding the mechanism of action and its functional response to CFA-NPs. Hence, the study is focused on the collection of nanosized CFA, characterization and their toxicity evaluation at molecular and genetic level in terms of cytotoxicity, oxidative DNA damage and mutagenicity in cell cultures. We have investigated the CFA-NPS toxicity via dermally and intratracheally in animal models. Also we have evaluated the ameliorating effect of quercetin-loaded PLA-nanoparticles against CFA-NPs-induced toxicity in vitro and in vivo.
