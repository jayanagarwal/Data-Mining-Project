RESEARCH EXPERIENCE:

2014-present Research Associate
University of Rhode Island
Institute for Immunology & Informatics, Viral Lab

Dendritic cells were isolated from human PBMCs in order to look at the effects of viral infection. Immunomagnetic isolation of CD14 positive cells was used as a source of dendritic cells. A cytokine secreting cell line, HEK-293T, produced recombinant IL4 & GM-CSF used for the differentiation of CD14 positive cells into dendritic cells. Analysis of the viral effects on the DCs was done by Western Blot, Flow cytometry, Luminex, and RNA isolation. Mitochondrial fractionation of the DCs was also performed for analysis of viral effects.

Investigated the in vitro growth of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma B cell lines (isolated from patients’ blood). A human B cell growth factor (IL-14), expressed only in high grade NHL-B's and activated normal T cells but not in normal B cells, was proposed to be an autocrine growth factor .
