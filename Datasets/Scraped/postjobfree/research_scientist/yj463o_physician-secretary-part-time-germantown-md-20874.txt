Grants

1. Title: Interactions between CD81 molecule and Hepatitis C virus
Grant Type: NIDDK Scientific Director’s Award. 2007 (I did not get the Award. The reason for that was not lacking the Scientific and technical merit in my proposal, rather I was too senior for the Award. Please see a part of Summary Statement: “The applicant has a commendable bibliography. Paradoxically these accomplishments lessen the appeal of this application for an award designed for first-time fellows. The proposal is scientifically solid and will make a strong contribution to the basic science of HCV infection. However the duration of previous postdoctoral experience by the candidate and the seemingly limited training benefit (since he has extensive research experience in hepatitis B) give this proposal a lower priority”.

1995
Amount awarded: equivalent to $20,000

3. Title: Molecular epidemiology of hepatitis C infection in China.
Co-Principal Investigator: Yong-Yuan Zhang
