Experience
SENIOR POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER JULY 1ST2014-FEBUARY 2015
Working on miR-133a mediated cardioprotection and looking for the role of miR-133a in mitigating inflammation and fibrosis in diabetic heart. Develop miR-133a based lentiviral vector for specific expression in heart.
Effect of exercise in ameliorating cardiac dysfunction and role of myokines
Independently developing and executing projects, writing grants and papers, train graduates and undergraduates

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER august1st 2009-june 2014
Developed as an Independent Investigator: Initiated, developed and completed several projects in the lab - involved in bringing new ideas, planning experiments, data analysis and paper writing
Scientific Writing: Helped PI and submitted myself local, state and national grants and fellowship. Submitted LB506 and NASS young investigator grant after approval of letter of intent. Submitted R21 although not scored but idea was appreciated and encouraged for resubmission. Wrote several IACUC and IBC protocols related to several projects.
Mentoring: Mentored undergrads, medical students and residents. My role was to provide them valuable research experience which included teaching them about our subject matter in general, projects per se and several techniques routinely used in the lab. I also had to plan their work according to their time commitment.
Lab management: Ordering supplies, inventory management and budgeting.
Developed an innovative idea for molecular therapy for spinal cord injury and cancer: To treat these complex diseases developed a molecular approach to treat them. Idea was appreciated in R21 review, NASS LOI.
Techniques established in lab: In my 5 years tenures I established cell culture, in vivo animal model of spinal cord injury, transfection and PCR protocols, immunofluorescences in tissue and cell culture, new injury protocol for in vitro treatment of spinal cord and cells, bioassays.
Presentation & Communication skills: Developed presentation & communication skills, presented work in several conferences
Organizational experience: Developed collaboration with faculty members on grants.
