10/2011 – present
Project: My research involves elucidating the role of SFRP2 in angiogenesis and breast cancer development.
Duties: Perform DNA and RNA extraction and analysis (Real Time PCR), protein analysis (Western blot, immunohistochemical staining and ELISA), and cell culture (cell line maintenance, viability assay, xenobiotic treatment, angiogenesis assays). Analyze and interpret experimental data and communicate the results at scientific meetings and in manuscripts.

10/2006 – 10/2011
Project: My research served to extend the mission of the National Toxicology Program by elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of occupational and environmental toxicants that have been identified as carcinogens. Duties: Perform DNA and RNA extraction and analysis (Real Time PCR, methylation specific PCR, mutation analysis), protein analysis (Western blot, immunohistochemical staining and ELISA), and cell culture (cell line maintenance, viability assay, xenobiotic treatment). Established new procedures in the lab, including protein analysis, cell culture, and methylation analysis. Supervise and train students in various techniques, including safety procedures, and data analysis. Analyze and interpret experimental data and communicate the results at scientific meetings and in manuscripts.

Postdoctoral Fellow, Biological Sciences Division, Reproductive Toxicology
4/2004 – 9/2006
Projects: My main project was focused on using a genome-wide microarray to profile the testicular gene expression changes that occurred following phthalate exposure and identify potential molecular mechanisms of testicular phthalate injury. An additional project was focused on studying the effect of phthalate exposure on celsr2 cadherin biology including protein phosphorylation and localization.
Duties: Designed and wrote study protocols and IACUC statements, supervised summer intern, analyzed and interpreted the experimental data and communicated the results at scientific meetings and in manuscripts. Designed, organized, and supervised animal studies. Performed protein analysis (immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, ELISA assay, immunofluorescence), cell culture (isolation and culture of cell lines and primary testicular cells, transient and stable transfection), and nucleic acid analysis (RNA isolation from tissue and cultured cells, DNA plasmid preps, recombinant DNA analysis).

9/1998 – 4/2004
Project: My thesis project examined the expression and function of Aspartyl (Asparaginyl)-Beta-Hydroxylase (AAH) in the SH-Sy5y human neuroblastoma cell line and determined the effect of AAH over-expression and inhibition on neuroblastoma cell migration.
Duties: Trained undergraduates and graduate students in various laboratory techniques. Performed RNA extraction and analysis (Real Time PCR, RT-PCR, in situ hybridization), protein analysis (cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, kinase assays, immunohistochemical staining, phosphoamino acid analysis, 2 dimensional electrophoresis), and cell culture (transient transfection, metabolic labeling, motility assays, and high throughput screening assays for analysis of cytotoxicity and cell survival).
