EXPERIENCE
Implant Research Center, Drexel U., Sch. of Biomed. Engr., Sci. & Health Sys. 11/2012-06/2016 PhD Research Fellow (Co-PI’s: Dr. Steven M. Kurtz and Dr. Marla J Steinbeck)
Investigated periprosthetic inflammation and biological responses in tissues around revised total disc replacements, and performed implant retrieval analysis of the explanted spinal devices
Identified key mechanisms contributing to wear-debris-induced neuropathies in spine after implantation of artificial discs
Compared implant damage, tissue wear particle concentration and characteristics (size & shape) based on design and biomaterials to determine influence on clinical outcome for advancing implant technology Drexel University College of Medicine, Dept. of Neurobiology & Anatomy 09/2011-10/2012 Graduate Research Assistant (PI: Dr. Ramesh Raghupathi)
Conducted collaborative research project investigating in-vitro mechanical stretch-induced neuronal damage, and cellular and molecular responses
Tested biaxial and uniaxial stretch models to evaluate damage specific to axonal compartments Rutgers Dept. of Biomedical Engineering, Piscataway, NJ 01/2009-09/2011 Undergraduate Research Assistant (PI: Dr. Martin L. Yarmush)
Assisted with neural differentiation research projects to accelerate oligodendrocyte differentiation of embryonic stem cells
Created multivariate, logistic regression model to optimize neuroregeneration in 3-D brain slices
Worked extensively on perfecting Organotypic Hippocampal Culture models for study of traumatic brain injuries, in addition, mitigatory effects of alginate-encapsulated mesenchymal stromal cells
(MSCs) were investigated
Highly trained in cell/tissue culture techniques, immunofluorescent staining, ELISA and other standard cell/tissue analysis protocols
Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, Warren NJ 05/2010-08/2010 Research Assistant (advisor: Dr. Greg Russotti)
• Applied and integrated concepts of buffers, stem cells & fluid mechanics for independent project
• Generated new approaches/protocols to improve efficiency of the culturing process for Placental Derived Stem Cells by eliminating need for carbon dioxide in controlled environment
• Played active role in CPD Team and assisted with multiple projects focused on producing numerous dose lots for experimentation and clinical production/trials
• Obtained insightful knowledge regarding patents, tech-transfer and commercialization process
• Worked 40-80hrs/wk for the department of Cell Process Development (CPD) SAI Y. VERUVA
