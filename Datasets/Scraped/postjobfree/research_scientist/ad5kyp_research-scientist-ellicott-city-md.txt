Faculty / Assistant Professor, Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (2015 – 2023)

RESEARCH PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

Held accountability for performing research on human mesothelioma cancer cells, showing that cancer cells are more addicted with amino acid glutamine (restriction, inhibition of glutamine entry in cancer cells). Performed various mesothelioma cell cultures and maintained and grew cell lines. Monitored glutamine restriction on cell growth, morphology change, spheroid growth and screened / isolated CRISPER/cas9 mediated SLC1A5 knock out single clones. Performed mice injection of control and glutamine transporter knockout cells.
Research showed that glutamine cell transporter gene significantly reduced tumor burden in mice (findings published in Molecular Carcinogenesis, 2023).
Effectively coordinated all research project logistics, including definition, specification development, risk management, change requests, progress reporting, communication, and scope management.
Conducted research on squamous carcinoma cancer cells to show that injection of human natural killer cell (NK) to mice suppressed tumor growth. Cultured human NK cells and squamous carcinoma cells, monitored effect of NK cells on SCC-13 cells growth, spheroid formation and invasion. Designed protocol to study the effect of NK cells on SCC-13 tumor growth in mice and optimized number of NK cells needed to observe tumor suppression.
Natural killer cell (NK) and maintained by Thermo Fisher Scientific form human donors suppressed squamous carcinoma cell growth, induced apoptosis, and reduced tumor burden in tumor Xenograft study. (Published in Molecular Carcinogenesis, 2023).
Facilitated management of entire research product lifecycle, including data / requirements gathering, collation, prioritization, and quality monitoring.
