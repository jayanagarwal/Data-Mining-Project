Study & Process Design
Patent Technology Responsible for design and performing a feasibility study to reform biogas to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, which led to successful accomplishment of the project goals and resulted in an ISI publication and submission of a provisional patent.
Publication Performed a mathematical modeling and experimental study of effective parameters on deposition of heavy organic hydrocarbons in porous media, which resulted in an ISI publication.
Publication Performed a study on simultaneous removal of NOx and SO2 with NaClO2 in a novel swirl wet system, which resulted in an ISI publication.
Process Improvement
Publication Developed a technique in fabrication of silicon carbide (SiC) membranes on highly permeable SiC supports for gas separation and improved their performance, which resulted in an ISI publication.
Innovation Performed competitive analysis to make recommendations for future improvements in terms of membrane quality and the use of more novel techniques such as iCVD. Teaching and Academic Services
Teaching Assistant Instructed and mentored graduate and undergraduate students in an attempt to weave the pace and content of the material to their expertise and interest. Encouraged students to develop, extend, and test their insights in the broader world and be more of a collaborator than a learner.
