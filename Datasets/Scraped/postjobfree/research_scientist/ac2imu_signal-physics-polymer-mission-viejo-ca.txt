Quantum Machine Learning Intern Sept. 2017 - Present
• Research and devise ensemble techniques for machine learning / deep learning problems based on strong classifiers to reduce training com- plexity, achieved good performance on binary and multi-label classification problems with large datasets.
• Design and customization of computational models and algorithms from scratch and from academic code / scientific papers.
• Conduct numerical computations and develop algorithms and algorithmic systems using Python in the iPython / Jupyter platform.
• Adept operation of toolkits such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, word2vec, SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib in unsupervised research development. California Polytechnic State University: San Luis Obispo San Luis Obispo, California Cosmic Air Shower Array (CASA) Research Associate June 2015 - Sept. 2016 Trusted to extrapolate meaningful information about the geospatial origin of incident muons and the associated vector of primary cosmic rays. Project required the design and implementation of an array of low-cost, secondary cosmic muon detectors, but was ultimately limited to R&D of the detectors and the array construction was left to future students.
• Successfully demonstrated independence and drive by self-educating on all aspects of project, signal aquisition, coincidence, biasing, detec- tion, data collection, circuit design, signal analysis, and surface-mounted diode (SMD) soldering were investigated and implemented.
• Designed and constructed a high-speed pulse generator with CAD, utilized ground plane design, radio frequency shielding, PCB layout design, modulation/waveform design, biased amplifiers, and thermal profiling.
• Achieved comprehensive understanding of Altium, data visualization tools, circuit analysis, as well as the use of electrical signal, function, waveform, and pattern generators, oscilloscopes, power supplies and signal analyzers in an independent setting.
