My general research interest is on optoelectronic applications through the utilization of band gap engineered 2D - materials, organic-Inorganic perovskites, chalcogenide perovskites, organic/inorganic hybrid hetero architectures. I follow Pulsed Laser Deposition, DC-Rf magnetron sputtering, thermal evaporation, Spin coating, solution-based methods, and other vacuum deposition techniques to fabricate those architectures. Characterizations of those smart systems are an integral part of my research and I employ a verity of methods to comprehend and establish a structural property link in the direction of useful optoelectronic applications. My specific research interests are as follows:
• Synthesis of organic-inorganic hybrid structures.
• Synthesis of organic-inorganic hybrid hetero structures.
• Synthesis and fabrication of 2D- materials, Bilayer structures, and Heterostructures.
• Synthesis of chalcogenide perovskite thin films for solar light driven multifunctional applications.
• In-situ dry process synthesis of organic/inorganic and MoS2, NiO, SnO2. TiO2, etc. The topics mentioned above are highly cross-disciplinary between materials Science, chemistry, and physics, but are connected to each discipline strongly to understand the ‘structure-property-function’ of a specific hybrid system.
