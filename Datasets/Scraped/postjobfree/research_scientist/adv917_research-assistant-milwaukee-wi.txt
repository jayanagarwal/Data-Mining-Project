Core Expertise
Data Gathering & Analysis - Magnetic Resonance Techniques - Analytical Methods - Intellectual Curiosity - MATLAB
People Management - Organic Chemical Synthesis - Microfluidics - Spectroscopy - Chemical Kinetics â€“ Statistics
Hands-on skills: I have received extensive training in various analytical and organic synthesis techniques during my scientific career. I have applied this knowledge to analyze various complex chemical systems using HPLC/LC-MS, TLC, UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorimetry, electrochemical, and magnetic resonance techniques. I have synthesized and purified different complex organic molecules and performed multiple conjugations of large biological molecules (polymers, proteins, and carbohydrates). I have extensive experience synthesizing nano- and microparticles (emulsification and solvent precipitation) using batch and microfluidic techniques. I have experience in various liposome preparation and modification. I have experience with enzyme reactions and detecting different analytes using enzyme-related kit systems.
