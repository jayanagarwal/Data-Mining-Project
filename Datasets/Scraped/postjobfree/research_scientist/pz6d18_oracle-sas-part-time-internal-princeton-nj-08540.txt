PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Senior Research Scientist II, Neuroscience R&D, Pfizer/Wyeth, 2003-2010
Was one of the key persons in clinical databases study and adverse-event monitoring for clinical safety biomarker hunting in Psychiatric diseases treatment. Reviewed and mined clinical database and adverse event case reports with great dedication and excellent medical knowledge. Extracted safety data, correlated adverse events vs. medications. Queried data and statistically processed data. Extensively studied biomedical literatures for leads verification. Identified biomarkers vs. certain drug adverse effects and validated them in animal models and clinical data from patient treated with certain anti psychiatric drugs. Generated summaries and wrote up reports. Presented results and shared ideas to team members and at monthly meeting with stakeholders. Great team player resulted a novel biomarker identified in this project, which would be utilized in clinical safety monitoring one of the most frequent adverse effects in the treatment of Schizophrenia. Patent filing and scientific publications are in process.
Played a crucial role in discovering new drug treatment for Schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease by working with external alliances internationally and internal collaborators at site. Responsible for driving timelines, reviewing/querying data generated by alliances, oversaw data quality and integrity according to SOP and GLP, uploaded data into database and maintained database. Site visit and teleconference communication regularly. Ensured regulations compliance. Made summaries and presentations to managers and government bodies for portforlile review. Great teamwork made three novel compounds moved into IND from collaborations. Achievements and contributions were recognized with Wyeth Excellence Award and promotion.
Worked on several side projects to understand the mechanism of schizophrenia. Co-authored five scientific papers in prestigious journals, including Nature of Neuroscience and PNAS.

Senior Research Scientist I, Transcriptional profiling, Neuroscience, Wyeth 1998-2002
One of the most pioneer people in Transcriptional Profiling technology in Wyeth, resulted a state-of-art Transcriptional Profiling Core Laboratory serving Neuroscience on-site in searching biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets in various psychiatric and neuro-degenerative diseases. Showed leadership ability on managing laboratory routines and reagents supplies, training junior staffs, organizing meetings. Communicated with clients regularly.
Transcriptional profiling studied Schizophrenia and Major Depression of human brains from Stanley Foundation and collaborated with medical doctors and clinical scientists in NIH and informaticians and statisticians internally. Performed genetic profiling of different regions of human brain at RNA level by using AffyMetrix micro array system, data generation and annotation. Leads identification and validation, database mining and bioinformatics studies. Three patents on biomarkers were filed and three research papers were published in this project.

Research Scientist III, Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases, Wyeth 1993-1998
Studied safety and efficacy of compound leads in animals with hypolipidemic drugs. Responsible for monitored blood lipid changes, drug safety profiles and PK/PD studies.

Clinical Research Coordinator and post market Safety Monitor Associate, Cardiovascular Diseases, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pa. 1992-1993
Post market medical device safety monitoring on restenosis of coronary artery post percutaneous coronary artery angioplasty in treatment of coronary artery disease. Responsible for:
Protocol review, CRF review and project planning and execution
Collaborated different functional areas for complicated heart function and blood vessel measurements in patients, monitored and reported adverse events
Managed site operations, communicated with investigators, patients and sponsor, wrote memos, reports and documents in accordance with internal SOPs
Oversaw data collection, review, validation and query resolution to ensure data’s quality and integrity,
Hosted and participated in project meetings and provided the team with trial progress to ensure study timeline and milestones on-track, followed up on action items

Clinical Research Coordinator, Oncology, Buffalo General Hospital, SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 1990-1991
Managed a Phase II clinical trial on retinol acid in treating acute leukemia. Responsible for patient enrollment, CRF data queries, adverse event monitoring and reporting, preparing tabulated clinical data in excel spreadsheets for Investigators. Also maintained clinical databases and presented data to study team.

Clinical Research Associate, Gastroenterology, Children’s Hospital of Buffalo, SUNY at Buffalo, NY 1986-1988
Worked on WHO (World Health Organization) sponsored trial on Home-Prepared Oral Rehydration Supplement Solution to treat children’s dehydration in acute diarrhea in developing countries. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of treating dehydration during acute diarrhea in children with an easy access and easy storage dry power package containing pancreatic enzymes and supplement salts for home preparation of oral rehydration solution with rice by care givers in remote areas. Responsible for data collection, review, validation, and uploading into database. Trial was run internationally in Indonesia, Thailand and other developing countries.
