WARDNER MUNASHE GWESHE
SELF-EVALUATION Self-driven bio-scientist aiming for career in biomedical research, translational medicine and academia. My high aptitude for life sciences led to the growth of my experience into a record of achievement and an exhibition of outstanding research skills. My background knowledge of human physiology, anatomy, infectious diseases, diabetes, and cancer is substantial, and I have diagnostics experience with zoonotic diseases which include virulent strains of Avian Influenza, Foot and Mouth Diseases, Newcastle Disease, Brucellosis, Tuberculosis and Rabies. I comprehensively know cell biology, molecular biology, gene profiling and cloning, medical and veterinary entomology, immunology, bioinformatics, pharmacology, industrial fermentation, mycology, microbiology, epidemiology, vaccine research and production, food microbiology and safety, and several other fields of biology. I have acquired operational dexterity in fast- paced laboratory environment. Have utilized the interdependence of the broad biological disciplines' spectrum and engineering to timely respond to problems, generating effective, lasting solutions for health and environmental problems. Zeal for continuous learning and discovery remains my key enabler for good work performance on both individual and team contexts. Maintaining a thorough grasp of trends in biomedicine, industry, and research continuously broaden my knowledge which makes me resourceful when solutions are required. PERSONAL
