EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES & RELATED SKILLS

Electrophysiology: Expertise in patch clamp technique in isolated neuron and smooth muscle cells, quantitative intracellular microelectrode recording and simultaneous mechanical from freshly dissociated smooth muscle tissue to assess the enteric neuron responses with administrating electrical field stimulation receptor agonist antagonist or nerve transmission inhibitors

In vivo experiment: Exquisite microsurgical techniques in operating on small animals such as mouse rat and guinea-pig. Ultrasonometric methods to measure the volume of the various organs in anesthetized small animals.

Immunohistochemistry: Whole-mount or frozen section preparations for immunochemical study e.g. 1) using various special antibodies and 2nd fluorescent antibody to express special proteins in difference mouse model for discovering interaction of multiple peptide or protein activities, 2) through test with special cell signaling pathway inhibitors and proteins expression change to analyze the intracellular mechanism in many physiological or pathological events., 3) Morphologically localizing neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in GI tract.

Confocal microscope: expertise in confocal microscope operation and general maintenance.

Live cell or tissue imaging: Use of high resolution (confocal and two-photon) light microscopy to explore events in living cells and tissues, with pH and calcium sensitive fluorescent dyes such as: SNARF BCECF (intracellular pH), Cl-NERF and HAF (extracellular pH), Fluo-3 Fluo-4 Fura Red and Yellow Cameleon mouse ver 3.0 for assessing the intracellular or extracellular microenviromental pH and Ca2+ ion alteration in various experiment situations.

Quantitative image analysis: Using Metamorph or Li-Cor Odyssey software to quantitatively analyze the confocal images data or results from Western Blot.
