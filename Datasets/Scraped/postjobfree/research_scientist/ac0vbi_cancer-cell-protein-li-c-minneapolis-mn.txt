Effective presentation and verbal communication of scientific information.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 2007-2012
Research Fellow with Dr. Matthew M. Ames
Lead and assisted with qualitative data collection and analysis as well as manuscript development. Collected and interpreted experimental data, prepared study reports, and presented findings.
Designed and executed in vivo studies in models utilizing new technologies to evaluate tumor burden. Performed large-scale murine xenograft studies to determine the efficacy of endoxifen compared to other anticancer agents in vivo and analyzed the effect of endoxifen on the estrogen receptor’s ability to act as a transcription factor.
Elucidated the mechanism of action of endoxifen antitumor activity in breast cancer. Examined several cell signaling pathways for involvement in endoxifen-mediated growth inhibition in both Tamoxifen-sensitive and Tamoxifen-resistant cancer cell lines.
Developed and applied innovative approaches for oncology. Elucidated the mechanism of action of aminoflavone antitumor activity in breast cancer and utilized radioactive drugs to measure aminoflavone cellular uptake, and binding to cellular macromolecules and DNA.

Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland OH 2001-2006
Graduate Student with Dr. David A. Boothman
Directed and managed the elucidation of the novel pathway by which beta-lapachone induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Examined several cell death pathways (apoptosis, necrosis, programmed cell death) for involvement in beta-lapachone-induced cell death.
Utilized UV spectroscopy for analyses of prodrug conversion under acidic conditions. Determined that beta-lapachone treatment produces toxic amounts of free radicals, specifically superoxide, depleting glutathione reserves, causing DNA damage and PARP-1 over-activation as well as endoplasmic reticulum calcium release.

Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA Summer 1999
Undergraduate Research Program with Dr. John Golbeck
Rescue of a point mutation in the PSI protein PsaC with beta-mercaptoethanol as determined by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR).
Bacterially expressed, purified and reconstituted mutant PsaC protein. Analyzed the ability of mutant PsaC protein to function normally with beta-mercaptoethanol rescue via EPR.

Valparaiso University, Valparaiso, IN 1998-1999
Undergraduate Research Program with Dr. Thomas Goyne
Development of a biological technique for the production of lactones via E. coli. Compared the quality of lactones made from genetically modified E. coli to chemically synthesized lactones.
