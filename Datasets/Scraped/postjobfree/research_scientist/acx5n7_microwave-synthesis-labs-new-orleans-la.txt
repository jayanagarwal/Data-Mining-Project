PROFILE

After completing his Ph.D. in Physics and 6 years of specialized postdoctoral research in the area of material science/nanotechnology, Dr. Vargas is an independent/associate researcher at Conicet in Argentina, overseeing projects in the field of applied physics. He is actively researching and contributing in two main local programs with technological interests, one is related to radar and microwave technology, with emphasis in magneto-electric components using magnetic thin films, nanotubes and magnetic-based nanoparticles, and the other is connected to nuclear instrumentation, with emphasis in gamma ray/neutron detection devices, exploring how to integrate and make a proper use of colloidal nanoscintillators with enhanced luminescent response. He has experience in nanotechnology manufacturing, in particular chemical synthesis and dc sputtering technique, standard clean-room procedures, helium/nitrogen low-temperature cryogenics, as well as key equipment and techniques used in materials characterization, magnetism, microwave broadband, optics, and radiation scintillation. He is able to work and communicate effectively in multidisciplinary teams, in which hard work, motivation and flexibility are required.
