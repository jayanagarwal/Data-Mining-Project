Designed a novel “cell-uptake selection” strategy to enrich cancer-cell specific internalizing RNA

aptamers, which dramatically enhanced the cellular uptake and therapeutic efficacy of the
aptamer-conjugated nanotherapeutics in targeted cancer cells.
This work was published in ACS Nano 2012, and highlighted by C&E News, ACS Nano, Science Daily,
Medical News Today, NanoWerk et al.
Discovered a new internalizing RNA aptamer XEO2mini that can target and enter androgen-independent
prostate cancer cells, conjugated this aptamer with drug-encapsulated polymeric (PLGA-PEG)
nanoparticle (NP), and evaluated pharmacokinetics, bio distribution, and therapeutic efficacy of
NP(docetaxel)-XEO2mini in PC3 prostate tumor-bearing mice models by systemic administration.
The manuscript is in preparation.
Characterized XEO2mini-targeted cancer antigen, which potentially represents a new biomarker for
prostate cancer diagnostics.
The manuscript is in preparation.
Optimized the techniques (e.g., nano-precipitation, single emulsion, and double emulsion) to formulate
PLGA-based polymeric nanoparticles for the controlled release of hydrophobic drugs (docetaxil) and
hydrophilic drugs (doxorubicin), proteins (TGF-ß) and siRNAs.
One product has been licensed to BIND Therapeutics, and currently in Clinical Phase II Trial.
Synthesized and characterized several nanoparticle platforms, including lipid-polymer hybrid
nanoparticles, lipid-polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles, surface charge-switching nanoparticles,
subcellular-targeting nanoparticles.
Developed a DNA self-assembled strategy to engineer targeted near infrared-responsive drug delivery
platforms, which provides combined thermo-chemo therapeutic efficacy in multiple tumor-bearing mice
models.
