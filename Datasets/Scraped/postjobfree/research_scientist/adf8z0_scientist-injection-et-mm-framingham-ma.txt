Work History
Boston University (Waxman Lab)-Research Scientist 06/2017 – Current
Concentrations: Knocked down long non-coding RNA in mouse liver using CRISPR-AAV system, studied the transcriptomic profile of constitutive androstane receptor-activated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatic cell carcinomas using RNAseq.
Developed a highly efficient method to produce, purify and titrate, rAAV8 and AAV-DJ.
Designed guide RNAs for multiple long noncoding RNAs, constructed gRNA into AAV vectors.
Delivered rAAV8 containing dSaCas9-KRAB and guide RNA into mouse liver through intravenous and intraperitoneal injection.
Confirmed the knockdown of long noncoding RNAs by q-PCR, prepare samples for single cell sequencing.
Cultured primary mouse hepatocytes to study liver-specific long noncoding RNA
Isolated RNA from liver chromatin pellet extract, soluble nuclear extract, total nuclear fraction, and cytoplasmic fraction, prepared cDNA library for RNA-Seq.
Studying the role of constitutive androstane receptor and Stat5b in the progression of fatty liver disease
Boston University (Salant lab) - Research Associate, Research Assistant Professor 12/2009 - 06/2017
Concentrations: Immune basis of membranous nephropathy (MN)
Purified Anti-PLA2R autoantibodies from sera of patients with MN and proved that it can bind and activate complement pathways in vitro.
Cooperate with clinical physicians to discover a new antigen (THSD7A) in MN.
Construct various domains of THSD7A and PLA2R into mammalian expression vector, and epitope mapping of anti-THSD7A and anti-PLA2R autoantibodies in MN.
Constructed full-length PLA2R and THSD7A lentiviral vectors, produced and purify lentivirus, and infected podocytes to establish stable PLA2R-expressing and THSD7A-expressing podocytes as in vitro models for the study of autoantibody functions.

Concentrations: Define the mechanism of proteinuria by studying podocyte injury.
Used Cre-Lox and shRNA-lentivirus system to knockdown FAK in vivo and in vitro, demonstrated that inhibition of FAK activation prevents podocyte injury by inhibiting focal adhesion turnover and podocyte motibility.
