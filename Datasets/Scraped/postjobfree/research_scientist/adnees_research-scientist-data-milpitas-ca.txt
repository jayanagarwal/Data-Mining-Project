Senior Data Scientist - Search Science at The Home Depot, Atlanta, GA October 18-April 21 Semantic Product Search:
• Developed deep semantic matching in e-commerce product search. Given a customer query, deep learning model retrieves all semantically related products from the catalog. The model is expected to increase key performance indicators by a large amount. I led deep learning model development in this project
• Utilized a new loss function that has an inbuilt threshold to di erentiate between the signals available in behavior data Led Product Knowledge Graph Enrichment and Search Retrieval Enhancement project:
• Built an active learning framework to discover product types and intrinsic product relations (this project accepted in KDD 2020 workshop of Knowledge Graph and E-Commerce). In total 7 Data Scientists, Analysts, Engineers participated
• Multimodal Deep Learning model to predict types of products. The model leveraged products’ titles, images, ... Query Classi cation: Mixed encoder neural model to predict multiple categories for a given query. User clicks employed as weak supervision to capture user intent. Leveraged continual learning pipeline to incorporate users’ new implicit feedback Automatic Product Categorization model: A Deep Learning based model which takes product’s information from a vendor and recommends relevant product categories. This model is expected to shorten on-boarding process time Led University Collaboration program: Mentored two computer science PhD students at Emory university. This was part of The Home Depot university-academia collaboration program. Two Papers recently accepted at SIGIR2021 Arti cial Intelligence Engineer at Stanley Black and Decker, Atlanta, GA February 18-October 18
• Abnormality Detection from Images: Collaborated with the department of Oil & Gas to develop computer vision algorithms for detecting defective areas in weld radiography images
• Product Review Analysis:Analyzed and extracted information from Stanley0s online product reviews using NLP and Deep/Machine learning algorithms such as POS tagging, dependency parsing, sentiment analysis, TFIDF, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
Machine Learning Research Scientist at Emory, Atlanta, GA May 16-December 17 Led Neural Networks-Based Model for Multi-modal Emotion Recognition project:A multi-modal approach for the emotion recognition that integrates information coming from videos and subtitles of Friends TV show was proposed. Dataset annotated through Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. In this project, I led two graduate students Text-Based Emotion Detection from TV Show Transcript (preprint version) :
• Utterance-level emotion detection from transcripts of Friends TV show by applying Natural Language Processing techniques
• Emotion of each utterance was classi ed into one of the seven primary emotions using the following approaches:
- A novel Sequence-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with an attention mechanism
- A combination of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and CNN
• The dataset was gathered through Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and is publicly available (link to the dataset) Collaboration with Evolution of Language and Information Technology (ELIT) team:
• Elit is developed by Emory NLP research group with collaboration of Amazon MXNet team to provide end-to-end NLP pipeline
Abnormalities Detection in 3D MRI Brain Images:
• Abnormalities detection in 3D MRI brain images using 3D CNNs, RNN-CNN models and Image Segmentation algorithms. The dataset was provided by the department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences of Emory hospital Machine Learning Research Scientist at Amir-Kabir University, Tehran, Iran September 11-January 13
• Simulated Passive Dynamic Walker (Robot) that energy lost in the collisions is balanced by kinetic energy gained going down a ramp. This allows walker to achieve dynamically stable limit cycles, resulting in a natural and anthropomorphic motion without any external energy input.
• Utilized spring on the hip joint, value of the spring constant determined by a Feed Forward Neural Network (Supervised Learning). All simulations proceeded by aid of MATLAB.
• The improved walker could walk at ramp angle 50% larger. In this project I mentored one under-graduate student Natural Language Processing Research Internship at CareerBuilder, Atlanta, GA December 17-February 18
• Applied NLP, Machine/Deep Learning algorithms for building a resume to job matching system SKILLS
