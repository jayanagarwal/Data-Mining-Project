RELEVENT EXPERIENCE:

Research Scientist, Drexel University College of Medicine/Context Therapeutics (Philadelphia, PA) 4/15- Present
My research focuses on targeting the sigma 1 protein in prostate cancer through through using novel sigma 1 antagonists to inhibit the Androgen Receptor axis of prostate cancer progression.

Adjunct Professor of Biology, Rowan University (Glassboro, NJ) Fall 2015 Semester-Present
I have taught the laboratory sections for a General Biology class that is for non-biology majors along with both genetics, and cell biology classes for biomedical engineering majors.

Post-Doc Fellow, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA) 8/13-4/15
My project is focused on understanding the role of the unfolded protein response pathway for the ability of plasma cells to cope with ER stress resulting from continuous antibody production. I am also interested in understanding the role the UPR has on the differences in survival of short-lived vs. long lived plasma cells.

Senior Research Assistant, Drexel University College of Medicine (Philadelphia, PA) 7/03 – 7/07
Identified mRNAs that are translated efficiently through microarray analysis during hypoxia.
Directly supervised two Ph.D students and trained them in various molecular biology techniques.
Responsible for ordering supplies, keeping inventory databases, keeping track of laboratory budget, maintaining logs for radiation usage in the lab.

Teaching Assistant, Drexel University (Philadelphia, PA) 1/01 – 6/03
Responsible for teaching recitations and lab courses to undergraduate students in a variety of courses.
These classes included: microbiology, genetics, developmental biology, biochemistry, and advanced cell biology.

Laboratory Technician, Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ) 11/98 – 1/01
Responsible for isolating lymphocytes from blood samples and maintaining lymphocyte cell cultures.

Laboratory Technician, Richard Stockton College (Pomona, NJ) summer of 1997 +1998
Responsible for isolating DNA from bacterial samples from various geothermal wells that were on campus.
