Columbia University, Department of Statistics Sept. 2019 - Present Postdoctoral Research Scientist Manhattan, NY
Research on the intersection of machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) New York University, Tandon School of Engineering Apr. 2018 - Aug. 2019 Postdoctoral Associate Brooklyn, NY
Research on cybersecurity (e.g., anomaly detection and tra c analysis) by leveraging machine learning EDUCATION
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Information Engineering Sept. 2012 - Jan. 2018 Ph.D. in Computer Software and Theory Beijing, China Hefei University of Technology, School of Mathematics Sept. 2007 - Jul. 2011 B.S. in Information and Computing Science Anhui, China EXPERIENCE
Encrypted Tra c Analysis, New York University Oct. 2018 - Aug. 2019 Core Member Brooklyn, NY
Abstract: targets to identify and classify encrypted tra c without needing to handcraft features and parse encrypted content, and then further improve network QoS according to the classi ed results
Proposed an end-to-end classi cation framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN), which can classify encrypted tra c with an accuracy of more than 90% without needing to parse the encrypted packetâ€™s content and using any header information. Moreover, the proposed approach has more than 3% improvement in accuracy compared to others (such as SVM). Anomaly Tra c Analysis, New York University Apr. 2018 - Apr. 2019 Core Member Brooklyn, NY
Abstract: aims to detect anomaly tra c (e.g., DDoS ) by leveraging deep learning algorithms and keep the network safe
Proposed a DDoS detection framework based on deep neural network (Autoencoder), which only uses normal tra c to build the detection model and can obtain 80% detection rate with 0 FPR. Moreover, it can detect new and unknown attacks, however, traditional supervised approaches may fails (such as Decision Tree)
Intelligent Analysis, Chinese Academy of Science Sept. 2014 - Jan. 2018 Core Member Beijing, China
Abstract: aims to discover anomaly tra c and unknown, potential security threats from network tra c collected from several government departments networks
Analyzed network tra c with statistical algorithms, such as Random Forest, and obtained more than 95% detection rate. Also, established a distributed system testbed based on Spark, and obtain more than 2 times in testing speed compared to a Mahout based testbed. Furthermore, distinguished two kinds of similar tra c (DDoS and Flash Crowd), and obtained 98% accuracy based on the features extracted by Autoencoder.
Invisible Watermark, Chinese Academy of Science Jul. 2013 - Sept. 2014 Core Member Beijing, China
Abstract: aims to protect images copyrights of a Chinese company by embedding the invisible water- mark into these images, and the watermark can only be extracted by the company
Investigated, designed and implemented the invisible watermark embedding and extracting algorithm, which ensures that it can not only minimize the quality loss of original image, but also maximize the quality of extracted copyright
