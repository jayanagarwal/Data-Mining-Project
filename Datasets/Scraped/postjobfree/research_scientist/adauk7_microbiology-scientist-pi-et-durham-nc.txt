RESEARCH INTERESTS

I have been working with retroviral glycoproteins since my graduate school years. For my thesis project I characterized functional important regions of the Rous Sarcoma Virus envelope glycoproteins. I did one of the first studies using site-directed mutagenesis, to demonstrate the role of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains in biosynthesis, intracellular transport and viral assembly of an Env complex. Using similar studies, I characterized the proteolytic processing of the env precursor and define the critical residues for this event. This work resulted in four publications that are cited in many papers and Virology books (Perez et al., J. Virol.61, 66). For my postdoctoral training I went to the lab of Dr. L. Montangier at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. There I cloned, sequenced, and expressed the envelope proteins of HIV African isolates using vaccinia virus vectors. At the University of Miami and Mount Sinai Medical center, working as an independent investigator, I got my first NIH award to study the oligomerization of the HIV glycoproteins. Using chemical cross-linking and sucrose gradients I demonstrated that the Env is a heterotrimer composed of gp120 and gp41 subunits (Perez et al., AIDS Res.and Human Retrov.10).
Later, at the University of Minnesota, working with Richard Price a Neurologist that described the AIDS dementia complex, I had access to a HIV-1 brain isolate, YU2, which was cloned directly from the brain of an AIDS patient with a severe encephalopathy. I was the first to express the YU2 envelope glycoprotein and showed that in contrast to the glycoprotein of a lab-adapted strain, it didn’t cause cell fusion in a cell indicator assay. This clearly showed that there were other membrane components needed for that event, that turned out to be the CCR5

coreceptor (Virology 215). More recently, I have been studying the role of Fc receptors on HIV neutralization. For that, I constructed lentiviral vectors encoding the human Fc receptors and
established indicator cell lines expressing the human IgG, IgA and IgM Fc receptors. We have shown that the high affinity FcγRI receptor can dramatically increase the neutralization capacity of human antibodies directed to the gp41 MPER region and nearby regions. This FcγRI effect on MPER mAbs can be seen with viruses from different clades and tiers (J.Virol.83). The FcγRI cell line has been very useful to characterize new MPER monoclonal antibodies and has been used by other groups to study ADCC as well. More recently, I have developed assays to study the role of the integrins α4β7 in HIV infectivity and the role of complement in the partial protection observed in the vaccine trial RV144. Currently we are studying the envelope modifications required to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies the most challenging aspect of producing a protective HIV vaccine.
