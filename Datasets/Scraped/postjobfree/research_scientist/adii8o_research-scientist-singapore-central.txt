I am working as a research scientist to make dielectric elastomer actuator
(DEA) based smart metamaterial devices. My PhD and current job involves various transparent conductive thin film coating material using PVD/CDV processes, inkjet printing, screen prinitng, flexo printing and so on to make DEA based tunable winkled surface for transpareny tuning and tunable smart sound absorbers. I have more than 6 years experience on physical vapour deposition
(PVD) based nanometric optical film coating and 3D Printing technologies
(Inkjet Printing) to make polymeric/metallic thin film electrodes. I have specialized on DC/RF sputtering and e-beam ev aporation based thin film deposition methods, inkjet prinitng and Aerosol Jet printing methods and screen prinitng seting up and application. Also, I have a good theoretical and experimental knowledge of MEMS fabrication processes (i.e. cleanroom processing) and their mechanical and optical metrology. I am also familiar with 3D Printing technologies (Stereolithography(SLA), Pro-jet, Polyjet, Fused- Deposition Molding(FDM). I took Nanyang Technological Universities’ Masters level MEMS course and Rapid Prototyping courses and passed them w ith an A+. I have successfully secured three different research grants while working in Temasek Laboratories at NUS. My proficient spoken and w ritten English w ill be plus point for documentation and publications.
