RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

1. Postdoctoral Researcher - Dept. of Chemical Engineering at Penn State University.

CO2 capture: Synthesized various grafted amine complexes (primary, secondary, tertiary and hyperbranched) on
SBA-15 support. Studied the influence of these grafted amine structures and surface densities on the
thermodynamics and kinetics of the CO2 capture (adsorption) process. Also, completed a comprehensive project
for NETL, Pittsburgh, USA on CO2 capture on polyethyleneimine (PEI) impregnated silica and PMMA substrates.

Precious metal catalysis: Conducted extensive adsorption microcalorimetry studies on Pt, Pd and Au nanoparticles
impregnated on alumina and silica surfaces to understand the effect of particle size, metal loading and metal
dispersion on heats of adsorption.

Fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC): Briefly worked on an Air Force sponsored project on the development of
catalytic reactions for endothermic cooling in hypersonic applications. In this project, I worked on the synthesis
and characterization of Fe-doped zeolites targeted for catalytic cracking reactions under bench-scale conditions.

2. Postdoctoral Researcher - Dept. of Chemical Engineering at Stanford University.

Clean coal: Investigated Hg-capture from simulated flue gases using brominated and sulfonated activated carbon
(AC) sorbents in various forms like powders, pellets and fibers.

Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction: Investigated a biomimetic approach to reduce CO2 electrochemically by using Fe-
Ni-S cubane analogues of the active catalytic core of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for
CO2 reduction in nature .

Synthesizing of ASTM-specified D975 diesel: Consulted a start-up company based in Carmel Valley, Ca in
synthesizing D975 from soybean oil feedstock. Analyzed samples using GC-MS and participated in fractionation
distillation runs at the company premises to optimize production of diesel, D975.

3. Graduate (Phd) Researcher - Dept. of Chemistry at University of Iowa.

Conducted extensive research on a heterogeneous catalysis project dealing with H2 generation from steam-reforming
of small chain hydrocarbons and alcohols using grafted “single-site” V/Zr mixed oxides on γ-alumina supports. The
objective was to understand the red-ox phenomena taking place on the surface during steam reforming and also to
determine optimal conditions required to obtain maximum catalytic activity.

TECHNICAL SKILLS

Experience with characterization techniques like DRIFTS, FTIR, UV-Vis, ICP-OES, TGA, DSC, XPS, XRD, GC, GC-
MS, NMR, SEM, Hg-Tekran Analyzer, Quadruple mass spec, Micromeritics ASAP-2020 etc. I also have expertise in
working with electrochemical setups, air-sensitive organometallic compounds using Schlenk line and glove box,
cleanroom facilities, breakthrough reactors and pilot-scale plants.
