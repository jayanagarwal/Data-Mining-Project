SUMMARY

My background lies in Imaging Processing, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. I have had successful experience in solving real world problems with image processing techniques, e.g.,
1. Large lump detection problem, raised by oil sands mining company, Syncrude. The system has been integrated into the company internal website.
2. Sea ice classification problem, raised by Canadian Ice Service who considered to integrate the system into their workflow. The work has led to a published journal paper in the noted IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing.
3. Bi-ventricular cardiac volume estimation problem. The work has led to a filed patent, an abstract published in the well-known annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and a journal paper accepted by a leading biomedical engineering journal, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering.
