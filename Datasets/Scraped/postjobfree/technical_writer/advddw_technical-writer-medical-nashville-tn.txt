I am an effective, charismatic leader, passionately collaborative and highly respectful of the talents and contributions of others who are needed to achieve the goals of the project at hand. As an instructional coach, I have applied project-based learning practices to increase teacher effectiveness and accelerate student achievement. Without any prior domain expertise, I was recruited to design and create all documentation for the Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities (UMBS) project at CSS, a Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac joint venture designed to reinvent the mortgage securitization process. I rapidly acquire new skills and operate on them for maximum business value, but my primary strength is to take the long view, visualize what needs to be done, formulate and execute a delivery plan, and lead others to engage with me during project execution.
