Designed, developed, and implemented approximately 40 new self-paced, asynchronous courses for eCornell’s online learning catalog across a broad range of subject areas from 2018-2022, including leadership, strategic decision-making, technical communications, financial technology (FinTech), artificial intelligence (AI), climate change, and employment law. With each of these courses priced at approximately $700, my work has helped generate revenue (and will continue to provide future revenue streams) for Cornell University’s external education initiatives. Scripted and launched a four-part series of YouTube-style video clips along with companion PDF worksheets illustrating how to lead effective sales conversations with business members and prospects. Rolled out in 2017, this blended learning design also incorporated activities on a social learning forum to stimulate further discussion in both manager-to-peer and peer-to-peer interactions. Manager coaching guides have provided additional reinforcement and learning. Combined with an introductory-level Business Banking Basics program implemented earlier, this in-depth, advanced-level learning curriculum helped drive extraordinary sales production year over year in our Business Banking line. From January through July 2016, our front line booked a total business loan volume of $252,000. For the same period in 2017, the front line booked a total of $2,555,000, an increase in sales production of 912%. Designed and developed a series of fresh, new scenario-based eLearning games, role plays, and supporting on-demand resources to increase learner engagement and enjoyment of potentially mundane content. These games have sparked increases in the number of sales referrals our front line makes to specialists and financial consultants in our home equity product line, IRA products, and investment offerings. Also helped envision and name our online learning periodical, which has been successfully applied on our front line and in select support functions as an on-demand learning resource for our 700-plus employees.
Was selected as a member of ESL’s inaugural Customer Experience Champions team by the Senior Vice President/ Director of Human Resources and Community Affairs. Working with colleagues from across our organization, we implemented an extensive array of new initiatives, programs, and tools that have enhanced our employee experience and customer experience--two strategic priorities. Earned a professional designation as a Certified Professional in Learning and Performance (CPLP®) from the Association for Talent Development in 2012, a credential that provides tangible evidence of my knowledge of workplace learning and my value to clients and employers.
