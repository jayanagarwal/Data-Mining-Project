Dear Hiring Manager(s):
When I noticed the opening, my attention sparked immediately. It aligns well with my experiences, passions, and skills. As such, I would like to take a moment to discuss myself and why I think we would make a great team.
As a dynamic and multifaceted creator, I have a passion for working with clients to fuel brand awareness and engagement, spanning over 5 years. During this time, I served multiple key roles including Audio Engineer at SheWellRead, Content Writer, Social Media Manager, Multimedia Specialist, Podcast Host at Eleven0Seven, and Freelancer.
In the latter role, I leverage my expertise to deliver user-friendly services, spanning technical writing, content writing, videography, and audio and media production. In addition, I am well adept at working with musicians and managers to strategically execute releases, including blogs, podcasts, and social media.
I also have extensive experience in conducting interviews and target-audience-driven research to augment content. In fact, thatâ€™s a big reason why I reached out, as I felt like these experiences and skills align with the job at hand. Moreover, I am emboldened by the work your company is doing but believe I could step in and provide value by helping drive your mission forward! To that end, I would welcome a conversation to understand your priorities and goals and how I can help achieve them.
Sincerely,
Kemakolam Muruako
