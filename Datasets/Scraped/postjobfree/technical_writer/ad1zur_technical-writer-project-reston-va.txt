JILL MCKIBBEN
Profile
In my career as a technical writer and trainer and QA application tester, I have proven my attention to detail and my ability to effectively communicate clear and concise instruction and effectively transfer my skills to others. As administrator of hybrid events, webinars/webcasts, and virtual events and producer of content recordings and follow-up materials and reports, my organizational skills and past mediation and conflict resolution training have allowed me use these skills to successfully work with various levels in the organization and with people of different backgrounds and respect for cultural diversity and abilities in sometimes difficult situations.
As a quick learner, I handle change management with high energy and positivity. I am results-oriented, skilled in motivating people and effective in addressing difficult situations using my extensive mediation experience. I've received accolades for my helpful approach.
I've received positive performance reviews throughout my professional career and many times I've been looked upon as a force multiplier/liaison for the company as I have interacted with the majority of departments & staff because I'm reliable & trustworthy.
