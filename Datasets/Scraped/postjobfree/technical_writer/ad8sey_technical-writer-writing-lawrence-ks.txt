Employment History
4/2023 – 6/2024
API Technical Writer
Randstad (Clinical Reference Laboratory contract)

On Agile teams, I created documents describing APIs and the API Developer Portal. This SaaS platform allowed customers to practice using APIs. I used ServiceNow to access business components (e.g., Azure APIM Enterprise Data Platform), tools, and team projects. Using SQL Server Management, I reviewed DB tables. I described XML and JSON code and created API guides detailing endpoints, requests/responses, and code examples. API descriptions included process flow diagrams. I also wrote documents describing the advantages of CRL’s approach to laboratory information access and the firm’s in-house electronic quality management system (eQMS). I set up a review and change process with trackable versioning. I attended multiple API and platform security training sessions. Because we stored personal data, the company limited access to databases, enforcing Identify and Access Management (IAM) procedures. In addition to my work, I attended security training, for example, “KnowBe4 ‘Social Engineering Red Flags’”.

11/2022 – 4/2023
API Technical Writer
Next Level Business Services (Mastercard DevZone contract)

Working with an Agile team, I created documents describing new Mastercard APIs and SaaS platform that provides customers with access to APIs via the Internet. I explained API request and response requirements, parameters, end points, etc. Describing platforms, I created quick reference guides and user guides focusing on key features, benefits, use cases, available resources, and company support. I created text in Markdown and used GIT commands to create branches and add, commit, push, and pull md files stored in content repositories. I used Swagger to convert JSON to YAML, display and comment on the code. After reviews, the documents were displayed in HTML on the Mastercard Developer Zone Azure platform.

7/2022 – 10/2022
API Technical Writer
Akraya (Walmart App Store and Developer Portal contract)

Working with three teams, I created a detailed Swagger User Guide based on personal and user experience.

Our Atlassian JIRA Service Desk IT service management approach enabled us to effectively direct customer service delivery.

11/2021 – 7/2022
Technical Writer
Matlin Silver (ADP contract)

Working with the National Account Services (NAS) team, I transformed 90+ technical Word documents into DITA-conforming XML files. These documents described the services available via the NAS SaaS portal. I created a standard operating procedure (SOP) manual explaining how to transform documents to DITA format. Using an Oxygen XML editor, I edited/rewrote text and XML coded the content. Then, I recorded the transformed results (identifying updates in multiple columns) on Excel spreadsheets.

I attended daily ZOOM team meetings and used JIRA (task creating/update/tracking), Oracle CRM Data Cloud UI (customer service reviews), and the Oracle Enterprise Data Management UI. I included user experience in documentation updates. When a technical review indicated significant sectional changes (e.g., descriptions of the need for a database change), I recorded change reviews results on Excel spreadsheets. This enabled us to verify changes with developers before publishing the document. I used an Oracle Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Data Cloud UI to review consumer information and wrote HR documents explaining how to handle potential employee and customer contacts. I created flow through illustrations with Adobe Illustrator and stored documents as Confluence page attachments. As the QA Lead for documentation, I reviewed and corrected all infrastructure cutover (IBM DB2 to Oracle PL/SQL) procedures (database transfer, continuous service recovery, backup, flow through security, etc.) and other documents by our team before they were sent to our client company, JPMChase.

11/2020 – 4/2021

Based upon reviews and IE6302 standards, I filled out Clinical Evaluation Reports (CER) indicating the regulatory compliance, safety, and tested performance of our devices. After document technical reviews, I performed a document change review to identify the specific differences between my original text and review-updated text. Based on user feedback, I created Change Orders justifying document updates, submitted Change Orders for review/approval, and incorporated requested updates in accordance with FDA regs (e.g., 21 CFR 820) for good manufacturing standards.
