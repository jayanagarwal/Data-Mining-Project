ELECTRICAL HAZARDS ON THE JOBSITE SSA 95-05

Instructions: First, read the text Our various jobsites can have an assortment of potential electrical
to the right to your crew. Next, hazards present. Electrical tools, devices, and equipment often have
ask the questions below. Read personal safety devices and intrinsic features to protect you, the
aloud any answers missed. operator. Though, if deficient or damaged, there can be serious risks.

Why can extension cords with missing or bent ground pins not be used?

1.The tool/device/equipment operator will not be protected from a severe electrical shock, or possible electrocution, especially if working in a wet or damp environment.
2.A short in such a situation could damage or ruin the cord-connected
tool, device, or piece of equipment.
3. It goes against our company’s safety policy.
4. Such is a violation of OSHA 1926, Subpart K.

If you feel a slight tingle when using
a power drill or circular saw, what
must you do? Why?
1. Stop using said power tool immediately.
2. Boldly label the power tool as: ‘Damaged – Do NOT Use’ and place in
the designated box or container for such items.
3.That tingling sensation is a sign that the internal-housing electrical insulation has broken down, meaning that some of the current is now passing through your body. More current could flow through you at any moment, posing an electrocution risk. Note: Only of an amp can be deadly for an adult.

Sometimes we must work on damp earth with electrical tools and equipment. What safety measures must we employ in such situations?
1. We must wear rubber-soled work boots.
2. We must don rubber gloves or work gloves with incorporated
electrical insulation.
3.We must make sure that extension cords do not lie in pools of water,
especially the junction between the extension cord and the cord of the tool, device, or piece of equipment.

You see an extension cord with a cut in it. You can see the wires inside. What should you do? And not do?
1. Do remove the damaged cord from service.
2. Do boldly label the cord as ‘Damaged – Do NOT Use’ and circle the
area where the cord is damaged with a marker, then place in the
designated box or container for such items.
3. Do not continue to use the compromised cord, as it could lead to
severe personal injury - or worse - and/or damage to the connected tool, device, or piece of equipment.
4. Do not tape over the sliced area.

UNIVERSAL WASTE STORAGE PROTOCOL AT CPCC

1.Incoming blown incandescent lamps/bulbs must be boxed immediately by lamp/bulb type, securely taped shut, and conspicuously labeled (with all lines of the purple Universal Waste label filled out, including the date of arrival). Such used lamps/bulbs cannot arrive in a trash can or 5-gallon pail, as it results in breakage of many of the smaller fragile lamps/bulbs, which creates hazardous waste.

2.Blown fluorescent lamps should be placed back into their original cardboard boxes if available, if not, suitable boxes are available in the universal waste storeroom (stacked flat on the top of the main orange shelving unit). Such boxes also need to be immediately taped shut and labeled.

3.Bad non-PCB ballasts need to be placed inside the labeled 55-gallon steel drum. Then the lid needs to be resealed with the locking ring. If you discover a PCB-containing ballast (very rare now), please set it aside and immediately contact Mike Bozart in EHS at ext. 6103 or via e-mail: adrlbl@r.postjobfree.com

4.Sealed lead-acid (Pb acid) batteries need to have their terminals taped over to prevent unintended residual current flow. They also need to be labeled. Also, they need to be stored upright – never on their sides.

5.Spent lithium (Li) batteries, the small round silver variety, need to be isolated by placing them between strips of tape. (The tape is on the gray shelving unit with the labels.) Next, lay the strips in the designated box on the gray shelving unit.

6.Most used alkaline batteries (AA, AAA, C, D) should be placed in the labeled cardboard boxes on the gray shelving unit.

7.Used 9-volt alkaline batteries need to be placed in the labeled box for such on the gray metal shelving unit in a fashion such that the terminals don't touch each other. Notice the cardboard separation strips in the labeled box.

8.When there are 20 or so boxes of spent 4-foot-long fluorescent lamps on the main orange shelving unit, begin to palletize them. Pallets are in the SL basement hallway next to the mechanical room rear door.

9.Blown 8-foot-long fluorescent lamps should be stored in a suitable box on top of the main orange shelving unit to prevent accidental breakage. Remember to place a label on the top end of the box (the side facing out).

We always need to stay in concordance with 40 CFR part 273. The fines for violations are not cheap, and the College has no desire for any bad press. Moreover, we don’t want to be featured on the local 6 o’clock evening news for a negative reason.

Thanks for your attention to detail. Stay safe.
