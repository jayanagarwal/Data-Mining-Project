SUMMARY
I have a proven record of handling any and all writing and publication requirements from initial inception and development, editing, illustration – all the way through the final publication process. I’ve worked with a vast array of document requirements from company operations manuals, floor assembly instructions, product description and repair, posters, flyers, library development documents, consumer how-to manuals and more. Typically, I am responsible for my own illustrations, so have advanced skills in computer graphics, industrial photography, and creative layout and design. I have developed my own computer fonts when requested and I’ve even hand drawn a comic strip to help explain a specific assembly procedure! WORK HISTORY
