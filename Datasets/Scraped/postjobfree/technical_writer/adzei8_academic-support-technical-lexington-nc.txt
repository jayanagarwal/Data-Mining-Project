PROFILE

First and foremost, I am a professional writer. I have the ability to provide strong documentation and communication skills within a team environment and with individual editorial projects. In my past working experiences, I have researched, outlined, written, and edited new and existing content, working in various scenarios to understand project requirements. I have created how-to guides in Word, produced descriptions for websites and compiled HTML/CSS files, designed graphics in Adobe Photoshop, enhanced hard-copy/electronic documents, and crafted magazines and flyers in Adobe InDesign. I have also managed multiple projects on strict timelines, demonstrated good problem-solving skills, and an eagerness to learn new technologies or methods of formatting.
