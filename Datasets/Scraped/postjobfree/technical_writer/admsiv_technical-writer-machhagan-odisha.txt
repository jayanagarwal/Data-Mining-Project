PROJECTS
Phishing site URL prediction
• Created an app using which identiﬁes a web-
site is a phishing website or not.The model
used is Logistic Regression and Multinomi-
alNB .The model is dumped using pickle and
deployed in heroku.
Spam-Ham Classiﬁer
• This model is used to predict the spam mails
or messages. The process includes removal of
stopwords, Text preprocessing and building
models. MultinomialNB Naive Bayes clas-
siﬁer is used for prediction . It requires in-
teger feature counts which can be done by
countvecorizer, TF-IDF is also used for frac-
tional feature count
Fake News Classiﬁer
• Aims to classify between fake news and legit
news.This model include data preprocessing
like eliminating null values,text preprocess-
ing like removig stopwords, lemmatization or
stemming,vectorization and model building
using multinomialNB which is very good with
text data.
Red Wine Quality Classiﬁcation
• Aims to classify the quality of red wine based
on various features like ﬁxed acidity,volatile
acidity,chlorides etc.Compared the accuracy
by building diﬀerent models such as Logis-
tic Regression, Random forest, SVM and K-
Nearest Neighbour. Random forest gives the
highest accuracy as compared to others
