Knowing Women: A Play in One Act
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009BRDACS/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0 September 2012
Set in the conservative suburbs of rural America in the late 1990s, Knowing Women is a comedy- drama that takes place on the morning after a late-night bachelor party thrown by a cynical urbanite named George for his younger brother Tom, who is getting married later that day. The play begins as the mother of the two men waits on the front porch for her wild elder son to come home from the previous night’s festivities. Having retired early, the favored younger son and groom asks his mother to go inside and get some rest before the big wedding day. When George arrives, the conversation that takes place shows just the power of family and how notions of love, sex, and marriage can clash as values change from one generation to the next. George’s twisted romanticism shows a longing for times past, but his lifestyle suggests apathy toward the new morality which borders on defeat. Tom’s reaction to his brother’s despondency shows the burden of idealistic love. When Tom’s fiancée Cathy arrives, she finds a partner altered by a confrontation that brings Knowing Women to a dramatic conclusion.

Self-Esteem: A Novel
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16038153-self-esteem August 2012
Successful self-help writer Dr. James Crawford is not happy. Crawford's professional success is greater than ever but his personal life is falling apart. He has endorsed a children’s TV show based on his writings, but the cartoon-like host could be up to no less than murder. During a nasty drinking binge, Crawford struggles with his wife and son and his son’s strange mentor, a popular talk show host, a business partner tired of Crawford's aspirations, a mistress who doesn’t understand him, an emotionally distant professor, a couple of college pranksters, a successful rap artist, and an ominous tormentor — all of whom seem to be pushing the famous guru toward emotional destruction. Self- Esteem is a dark and earthy satire on vacuous "self-help" culture with a careening air of inevitable catastrophe. It's juicy, dirty, and funnily serious. A look inside the mind of a guitar virtuoso
