PhD Thesis – Biochemistry -SS Isozyme of HLADH - Developed a multi-step purification procedure for the steroid-active isozyme (one of nine) of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase. Executed two-dimensional initial velocity kinetic studies in the presence and absence of inhibitors to determine the mechanism of action.
MSc Thesis - Biochemistry – AK I/HSDH I -Developed a targeted enzyme modification method to selectively incorporate cobalt into four of the allosteric enzyme's eight active sites inactivating one of the two enzyme functions to study how changes at one set of active sites were communicated to other set sites on the enzyme.
MSc Thesis - Management Evaluated the use of survey questionnaires as tools for measuring the status of employee/management relations. Developed a survey questionnaire and wrote a software program to analyze the survey data to analyze the climate of an organization.
Twelve Publications in scientific books and refereed journals and Nine Abstracts.
MS Excel Applications - Developed spreadsheets for managing sample testing schedules, for tracking samples submitted to extramural contract testing labs, for monitoring stability sample pull dates, and for calculating project/time allocation.
Established standards for technical report writing, formats for protocols and reports for assay validations and investigations, for monthly reports, and for project summaries/status updates to facilitate closure of OOS and OOT investigation reports and to reduce testing error rates.
Quality Management System
Managed Quality Control/R&D/ Analytical Services Laboratories. Designed lab space, critically evaluated instrument needs, and purchased and installed instruments to support an analytical method troubleshooting laboratory.
Restructured the QC department along functional lines and authored job descriptions, description of responsibilities, and training modules to facilitate compliance with GMP training requirements.
Established a Logbook Program to record the chronological history of instrument and equipment use and maintenance in a GMP compliant manner.
Implemented standardized procedures for calibration expiry labeling of departmental equipment and instruments to reduce sticker clutter on GMP compliant equipment and instruments.
Innovation
Managed a $9MM high purity solvents business targeted for scientific and technical markets - Prepared and implemented business plans and developed financial models to support business projects.
New Product Line Development - Successfully championed a new product line of high purity solvents packaged in returnable stainless steel containers (now marketed as Cycletainers) after demonstrating proof of concept and overcoming resistance from all departments in an organization accustomed to marketing specialty chemicals in one-way disposable containers.
UV Vis Method for Production Process Control - Developed, and validated a UV Vis spectrophotometric assay for in-process addition of tocopherol (Vitamin E) for new product.
NDIR TOC Instruments - Championed nondispersive infrared total organic carbon (TOC) instrumentation to eliminate atypical assay events that were occurring with conductivity based instruments.
Color Determination by UV Vis - Championed the use of spectrophotometric instrumental methods for color determination based on application of the three dimensional CIE color space to eliminate the errors introduced by visual inspection.
Time Out of Refrigeration Calculation Aid - Solved time-out-of-refrigeration calculation errors by championing the use of a specialized calculator and authoring a job aid for calculator operation. The calculators were informally named “Casculators”
Problem Resolution
Determined Root Cause of Bias in GC Assay Results - Mathematically determined that the root cause of low bias in several years of GC assay results for denatured alcohol raw material was due to a density mismatch between samples and standards. Re-designed the assay to eliminate the bias and restore accuracy.
Determined Root Cause of apparent Excess Recovery of an Active During Surfactant Production - Successfully executed bench scale studies of the manufacturing process for a complex biopharmaceutical consisting of four water insoluble active ingredients including a peptide, a fatty acid, and two phospholipids and proved that apparent excess recovery of one of the actives was due to high bias in ELSD HPLC detection of the active ingredient.
Determined Root Cause of UV Vis Colorimetric Test Variability - Identified sipper carryover as the root cause of excessive variability in results for two colorimetric UV Vis spectrophotometric assays. Defined mathematical equations to provide worst case estimates of the impact of sipper carryover on ten years of historical data.
Resolved Low Bias Problem - RNASE T1 - Proved that the low bias in an assay for RNase T1 was due to the presence of an inhibitor in newer batched of RNA substrates. Revised the assay to include a pre-purification procedure for the RNA substrate restoring assay performance.
Cell-Based Bioassay Validation Assay for Antibodies to Measles - Statistically demonstrated that validation attempts failed because precision acceptance criteria needed to be reset by applying propagation of uncertainty principles applied to assay performance data. When this was done the assay was successfully completed.
Resolved Enzyme Assay Problems - Glucose Oxidase and Lactoperoxidase - Remediated the two assays by incorporating the use of a cuvette stirrer for assay execution. Taught chemists proper enzyme assay techniques remediating assay inaccuracy and lack of precision.
