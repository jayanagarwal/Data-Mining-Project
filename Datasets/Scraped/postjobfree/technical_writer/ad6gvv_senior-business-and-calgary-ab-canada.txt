Good day.

My name is Rose Anne Hutchence and I am one of the best writers in the business.

And I am one of the lucky ones! Privileged to work with bright people, constantly learning, I get to do what I do best and at the same time contribute to the success of a company. What could possibly be better?!

Since starting my consulting business, WordsWork! Communications, more than 25 years ago, I have worked with many, many clients, from large corporations to single-entity start-ups, students working on dissertations and authors looking to self-publish their material. I have helped my clients with innumerable aspects of their projects and my skillset has thus evolved to include virtually every facet of writing and editing, including but not limited to project management, content strategy, corporate communications, proposals, feasibility studies, press releases, business development, speeches and presentations, operations and maintenance manuals, business and marketing plans ….

My abilities are best utilized with complex concepts - finance, engineering or legal, for example - but I have of course worked with the opposite end of the communications spectrum: blogging, writing web content and social media posts. My preference remains with the complex.

Recent projects include working with North West Redwater Partnership (their Sturgeon County Refinery project). Creating charter and project implementation policies in addition to subsequent strategy, standard and procedural documents for all functional and business units were my responsibility as were developing formats, editing and research. I worked extensively with subject matter experts from the inception of the project and the initial three-month contract lasted 20.

Prior to the refinery project, Enersul brought me on board to write Construction Sequence, Pre-Commissioning / Commissioning / Start-Up, Operations and Maintenance Guidelines documents for their numerous sulphur forming process equipment. I was fortunate to work with many engineers who were invaluable in completing these documents and numerous interviews were necessary. We also worked together to provide training material (documents as well as PowerPoint presentations) for Enersul’s clients around the world. The company extended my contract and asked me to assist with quite a number of other initiatives, not least their ISO documentation / application and proposals (preliminary as well as technical and commercial). Writing quality assurance processes / procedures as well as work instructions were the tail end of the projects with which I was involved before that contract ended.

Additional information is available at https://www.linkedin.com/in/businessandtechnicalwriter/. Wordswork.ca is currently undergoing significant changes, but numerous testimonials – including one from Enersul – are available upon request.
.
I am reasonably bright, quite hard working, learn quickly and would be delighted to apply all my experience and abilities to your requirements and benefit. Further, my research, analytical, written and interpretative skills are exceptional. I am very computer literate with excellent time-management skills. I work extremely well independently, but enjoy teamwork too.

My objectives? Providing quality work-related services over and above expectations, taking responsibility, meeting challenges, the opportunity to use my many skills and abilities as well as the chance to grow and learn.

My CV is attached. I hope that document and this letter interest you, and trust you’ll consider bringing me on in a contract capacity. Many thanks for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
