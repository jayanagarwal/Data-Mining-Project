Employment History
I have used the following applications in conducting process/business analysis and creating documentation:
MS Word, Confluence, Visio, Jira, PowerPoint, MS Excel, HPQC.
My industry experience has been extensive in both the private and public sector. I have had an on-going relationship with the Roads and Traffic Authority (Roads and Maritime Services) that spanned a 20-year period. I also have had an on-going relationship with origin energy (3 separate contracts from 2006-2007) and enjoyed a hectic but rewarding 15 months at News Ltd (2005-6). I think such experience has illustrated flexibility and adaptability in a diverse range of environments.
I feel I have demonstrated initiative in many different roles and capacities in both the private and public sector and that I am flexible in my approach, often working across a range of projects at times simultaneously. I also think I have shown an ability to work with a variety of SMEs, and overall still be able to get not only some information but the best, most relevant information (not always a straight-forward task!).
Fundamental to the role of Technical Writer is the ability to work under pressure. This certainly was a requirement when working in finance (FICS 1998-2000), St George Bank (2001), Westpac Bank (1999), KPMG 2003-4), in market-based entities (origin energy) and at News Ltd.
I have found that I thrive in this kind of environment!
I am interested in working in a dynamic environment with high standards.
