Work Experience:
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – 500 12 th
St. SW, Washington DC. October
**** ** ***** ****
I worked in the Incident and Special Response Unit (ISRU) for the past 7 years. The ISRU coordinates and oversee operations that support the prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery plans for critical and significant incidents such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, man-made or accidental disasters, and other national emergencies or incidents. As an ISRU member I wear many hats. One of my responsibilities is the lead in the quarterly reporting for Occupant Emergency Plans (OEP) for our Field Offices. I improved the process so the spreadsheet for reporting has been uploaded to a SharePoint site where every office has access to upload their latest exercises and training efforts to support the OEP.
I am on the Emergency Management Readiness and Assistance Pilot Program (EMRAPP) team that ISRU implemented in 2018. The ISRU developed the EMRAPP to provide readiness assistance directly to field offices in order to improve field office resilience during an emergency incident. Each field office is visited by Emergency Management Specialists from ISRU who interviews personnel, conduct select site visits, such as an Alternate Operating Facility (AOF), and aid the field office in self- identifying any areas for improvement to better prepare for future emergencies. After the initial visit ISRU staff returns to the Field Office to train personnel on how to write emergency plans using the Department of Homeland Security Department Plan Development Process (DPDP). I completed the training for the DPDP, the standardized planning process for the Department of Homeland Security, and I have also completed the DPDP Train-the-Trainer course so I am now teaching the DPDP to ICE Field Offices around the country to assure they know how to write emergency plans, to assure they have emergency plans in place and that they are up to date. Using my writer/editor background I am also the editor for any documents that are created in ISRU, all relating to emergency management in some respect. Additionally I am a Surge Capacity Force (SCF) member as well as on the ICE SCF Program team. I assist the SCF Program Team manager in deployments, training, and any needed documentation for the program. ISRU Past Projects:
• ISRU Lead in the quarterly reporting for Occupant Emergency Plans (OEP) for Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Field Offices. Improved the process for reporting by uploading the spreadsheets to a SharePoint site where every office has access to upload their latest exercises and training efforts to support the OEP.
• Certified instructor on the Emergency Management Readiness and Assistance Program (EMRAP) team that provides readiness assistance directly to field offices to improve field office resilience during an emergency incident
• During the 2018 Hurricane season, I was on the Crisis Action Team for Hurricane Michael, where I participated in the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) for meetings, conference calls, and briefings to help coordinate response efforts for ICE facilities in the path of Hurricane Michael.
• Writer and/or Editor for any emergency management documents that are created in ISRU.
• Surge Capacity Force (SCF) member

My position with the Verification Division I was a member of the Front Office staff. I worked closely with senior leadership to assist with taskings and projects that supported the division’s major programs, E-Verify and Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE). All documentation created in the Verification Division must go through me for review, editing, and assuring that it is in plain language before being released. I researched, reviewed, wrote, and copy edited a variety of documents including correspondence, reports, articles, press releases, newsletters, briefings, presentations, training materials, memos, manuals, testimonies, speeches, public facing documents, and congressional responses. I reviewed documents with consideration to overall objectives and mission of DHS and USCIS in determining content and method of presentation and assure we met all security requirements. Review also includes identifying problems such as reconciling contradictions, correcting any misconceptions, and interviewing and consulting subject matter experts and program officials when information has gaps or is conflicting. While with USCIS I completed the training and secured approval to become a Surge Capacity Force Member/volunteer for DHS.
