I believe my Technical Writing skills make me a strong candidate for this position. My experience includes How-To Instructional and Training manuals for shop floor machinery, government aviation test plans and reviews, and project management procedures. Documents I have written, edited and proofed for peers and the team members under my management range in length from 5 pages to well over 500. I have adhered to standards such as ISO 9001. My skills and experience led to a promotion from Technical Writer to Technical Writing Team Lead.
The styles and formats have ranged from complex test procedures and reports with the end user possessing decades of technical knowledge, to writing step-by-step processes at a 3rd grade reading level.
If my experience awards me an interview, I believe after the interview I will be a strong candidate for this important position. In an interview everything that cannot be conveyed on paper such as glimpses of my personality, my personality type, how I communicate with others, confidence in my experience and conveying how I navigated through challenging situations both as a manager and a team member, will be showcased.
Thank you for reviewing my application, resume, and cover letter. I hope to be in contact with a member of this team shortly. Good luck in finding the perfect candidate for this position.

Respectfully Submitted,
Aaron Versch
