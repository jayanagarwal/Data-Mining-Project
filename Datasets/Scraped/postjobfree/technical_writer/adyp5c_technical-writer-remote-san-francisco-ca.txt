PROFILE

I am an experienced agile technical writer that develops documentation including Application Programming Interfaces (API), Software Developer Kits (SDK), functional specifications, and user-level content. Strengths include implementing the conceptual design and revising/restructuring information for technical or non-technical users. Tasks include testing protocols, procedure-oriented reference materials, system administrator, and end-user guides—creating web-based content and programming interactive, database-driven responsive web design websites.
