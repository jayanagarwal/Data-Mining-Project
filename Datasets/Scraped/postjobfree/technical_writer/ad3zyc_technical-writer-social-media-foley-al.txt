To whom it may concern,

I learned from your listing via LinkedIn that you are actively aiming to fill a freelance writing, AI tutor position. Working for your company is inviting because the company’s investments in services and research are important. I feel that my skills as a technical writer will complement the position in content and creativity and will immeasurably aid in innovative projects.
My education in technical writing is supported by an English degree from the University of South Alabama, which I anticipate completing in May 2024. Within this degree, I have had the opportunity to create various professional documents, advertisement content, and grants.
I believe that writing effectively is a crucial component of successful communication. As a communication minor, I have taken courses in communicating ethically and persuasively through style of approach and appropriation. Using these skills professionally will further refine my ability to create successful content. In doing so, I can aid in organizing information to solidify the company’s connections and support future growth.
I look forward to discussing the position more. I can be reached by phone at 251-***-**** or by email at ad3zyc@r.postjobfree.com to schedule further interviews. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Karsyn Phelps
