Chronological Work History (Howard Mayrant 2008-2022):

Nov 2021 – Aug 2022: Optum Health Services (Contract Assignment): My primary task was to evaluate project requirements for all system output reports that will be needed and make them available on implementation day. Working with my team, I delivered eight weekly reports and ten monthly summary reports on project deliverables.

Feb 2013–Aug 2021: First American Corporation, Santa Ana (Full Time): As Technical Writer and Business Analyst at First American for nearly nine years, I was responsible for designing and programming the company’s user documentation residing on their new ‘SharePoint System’ data repository. It was used to maintain total online data integrity of all the company’s computerized systems. It also maintained all supporting production documentation including all production user manuals, which eventually contained a total of over 300 of my production-system documents that I authored over my eight-year+ tenure with First American Corporation (37 documents per year)!

October/2012 – December 2012 – CoreLogic, Irvine Spectrum (Contract Assignment):
As Technical Writer/Business Analyst, I worked with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to develop data field definitions for Core Logic’s ‘Census Demographics’ databases. The assignment included multiple projects, such as ‘Tax Services Activity’, 3rd Party Demographics’, ‘FBI Crime Statistics’, ‘Maximum Sales Trends’ and ‘Excluded Parties Listing’.

April/2012 – September 2012 - PNC Bank, Laguna Niguel (Contract Assignment):
As Senior Technical Writer for PNC Banks, I reviewed, Analyzed, and created ‘Single Point of Contact’ (SPOC) Policy and Procedures documents used by all Bank Retention & Liquidation Negotiators at all PNC Bank branches. I was also asked to design and create PNC’s first ‘Contractor’s Quick Reference Guide’. For this new documentation, I was asked to investigate and integrate all relevant processes from the ‘Advanced Commercial Banking System’ (ACBS).

Nov/2011 – February 2012 – Southern California Edison, Chino (Contract Assignment):
As Sr. Technical Writer/Web Applications Developer, I designed and programmed a new ‘Learning Management System (LMS)’ for SCE’s instructor-led compliance training, which was to completely replace all old Instructor-led training courses. I developed a new upgraded version of their ‘Spill Prevention and Control’ training program using the newly available ‘Articulate Studio 09’ product. My new multimedia course included new and exciting features, as narrations, musical fade-in/fade-outs, in-stream quizzes, and auto-scored testing. The new course established a model standard for SCE’s eventual conversion of ALL ‘instructor-led’ training to be replaced by ‘self-help’ training!

April/2011 – September 2011 – Bank of America, Laguna Niguel (Contract Assignment):
As Senior Technical Writer, I both researched and documented updated corporate policies and procedures for all of Bank of America’s Service Departments of Special Circumstances. In this capacity, I also published to all B of A branches on the ‘Policies and Procedures Portal’ (Internet). All of the newly revised policies on ‘Short Sale Customer Escalations’ and ‘Residential Foreclosures’, were required to informed all of B of A branches across the entire nation.

Jan/2008 – December 2010 – Dept. of Homeland Security, Laguna Niguel Federal Bldg. (Full-Time):
As their Senior Training Specialist, I was responsible for training Customs and Border Protection Agents in the use of the entire ‘Microsoft Suite’ (including MS Word/PowerPoint/Excel/Access/Outlook). This project assignment included preparing and documenting my own class training materials, including my Instructor’s Guide and Student Guides. Each of my documents had to pass the highly stringent DHS training materials documentation guidelines.
