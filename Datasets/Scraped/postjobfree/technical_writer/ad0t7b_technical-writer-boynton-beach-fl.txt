Fred Jeffrey, CIO
ad0t7b@r.postjobfree.com 954-***-****
Technical Writer/Instructional Designer (Training) - Software Applications
Developed context-sensitive (page-level) online help, quick reference guides, user guides, implementation and administration guides, for 8 software applications.
Developed online software training videos that helped the Corporate Training Director train end users to perform their roles per requirements and specifications defined by HeathTrust and maintain compliance with HIPPA and with corporate standards, policies, and operation procedures, and to pass audits by the OIG (Office of Inspector General), HQIP (Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership), and JCAHO (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations).
Performed remote and classroom training for a software suite of 8 applications.
Collaborated with corporate LMS (Learning Management System) staff to host instruction modules so that any BU (Business Unit) manager could assign any LMS module to individual employees, and track completion status or pass/fail scores recorded in the LMS after the employees completed quizzes designed for each module, based on knowledge that the BU flagged as mandatory.
Collaborated with Developers to add embedded help for software fields, tabs, buttons.
Diagrammed current business workflow processes so management could identify redundant or manual processes for streamlining and/or automation. Interactive meetings with SMEs who were selected and delegated by each BU manager allowed us to identify current business workflow processes, display the workflow on a wall monitor during the interactive work session, and achieve agreement from all participants about the accuracy and completeness of the business process workflow diagram. After we identified and documented the ACTUAL business process workflow, we then edited the workflow diagram to represent the ideal process that would improve either the efficiency or the outcome of the workflow process, and we called that a PLAN. The result of each interactive work session was two-fold: one business process workflow diagram to show ACTUAL, and another workflow diagram to show the ideal PLAN.
Collaborated with Business Analysts and SMEs to identify functional requirements.
Collaborated with QA Analysts to write Functional Tests for enhancements and fixes, and to write User Acceptance Tests (before release to QA).
Worked with BAs and Developers to improve redundant data entry (and opportunity for duplication and error) so that many data fields would populate with dynamic data because we implemented target-to-source mapping—mapped target fields to key source fields or creating algorithms to calculate values obtained from one or more key source fields.
Worked with DBAs (Database Analysts) to create a separate Training environment on the main server so that the Training Director (and all Training staff) had all 8 software applications and also transaction data that showed all the business process workflow performed by HealthTtust staff. My job was to change the real names of all fixed data, such as real facility names, real personal names and addresses, and other entities, to fictional names, and then to map all the real transaction data (business process workflow) to the source data (previous real fixed data such as real facility names) so that the Training environment was 100% fictional. The fictional Training environment was my source for software training videos for Trainers to use and also software demo videos for Account Execs to use as demos.
Developed all content by hands-on use of the software, performing all tasks required by each user role. Captured videos and/or screenshots of each step (and result) that I performed.
Developed SOP (Standard Operating Practice) documents and online forms.
Reason: Parent (HCA) replaced Parallon software, developers, DBAs, BAs, and tech writer.
