• Certified EMC/EME/EMI/EMP/HIRF/TEMPEST Test Engineer and Technical Writer with over 40 years of proven performance in independent certified test laboratories and manufacturing facilities specializing in compliance testing, failure analysis, design engineering and test documentation services.
• Performed testing on Military, Aerospace, Automotive, Avionics, Commercial, Medical and Industrial subsystems/systems/ components to industry test standards and custom-written test procedures.
• Applied continuous process improvements that streamlined workflow, maximized productivity, developed cost and time- effective solutions, and enhanced operations and profitability that delivered irrefutable and reliable top-line results. NOTABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
• Endorsed and recognized by established high-profile corporations and organizations (i.e., U.S. DoD, National Security Agency, Airbus, Boeing Company, Crane Aerospace & Electronics, Honeywell International, Inc., L-3 Communications, Lockheed- Martin, Raytheon, Rockwell Collins, Teledyne Electronics, Thales Avionics, Rolls-Royce, United Technologies Corporation, et al.) for cumulative test engineering cost savings in excess of $4,000,000.
• Selected and served as a TEMPEST Technical Advisor for design and test engineering reviews in Los Angeles, CA and Fort Meade, MD for TOP SECRET/COMSEC projects developed, created and enforced by the National Security Agency in conjunction with Hughes Aircraft Company worth in excess of $12,000,000. PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
National Technical Systems (NTS), Los Angeles, CA 2021 – 2023 Senior Technical Writer (Full-Time Position - $37.00/hour) Notable Achievements
• Prepared, composed, edited and submitted EMC/EMI and Environmental Engineering test plans, test procedures and test reports and provided remote test engineering consulting services for all NTS test facilities worldwide.
• Invited at company endorsement to provide short-term test engineering services as a technical support EMI Test Specialist at NTS test facilities in Huntsville, AL, Orlando, FL and Longmont, CO to assist in and lead understaffed test engineering projects requiring completion by a set deadline with a 100% success rate. Solar Electronics Company, North Hollywood, CA 2019 – 2021 EMC Technical Associate (Part-Time Contract Position - $25.00/hour) Notable Achievements
• Client EMI test engineering liaison acting in the capacity of consulting with and answering client questions about Solar Electronics Company’s product line (transient pulse generators, current probes, LISNs and test fixtures) for their custom test engineering applications (MIL-STD-461, RTCA/DO-160, CISPR, FCC, IEEE, etc.).
• Performed diagnosis, repair and calibration of the entirety of Solar Electronics Company’s test instrumentation inventory. Crane Aerospace & Electronics, Burbank, CA 2016 – 2019 EMC Senior Research Technician (Full-Time Contract Position - $29.00/hour) Notable Achievements
• Client EMI test engineering representative selected to supervise and direct all on-site EMI testing at independent test laboratories (i.e., DNB Labs, NTS Labs) for contract test programs (Airbus, Boeing, COMAC, Embraer).
• All programs had requirements for on-time completion dates and all programs were completed ahead of schedule with a 100% success rate.
• Prepared EMI test procedures for all off-site test engineering programs.
• Assisted in the development and construction of an on-site EMC/EMI test laboratory in Burbank, CA.
• Performed EMC/EMI tests in this laboratory using the ETS-LINDGREN EMCenter.
• Trained personnel in the use of the EMCenter’s instrumentation and software (ETS-LINDGREN TILE! Version 7) for EMC/EMI pre-test engineering and qualification tests. This effort saved Crane Aerospace & Electronics incalculable thousands of dollars in test and design engineering costs and marked program schedule timetable savings by resolving all potential test failures in- house as opposed to committing this expense and time in an independent test laboratory. 2
