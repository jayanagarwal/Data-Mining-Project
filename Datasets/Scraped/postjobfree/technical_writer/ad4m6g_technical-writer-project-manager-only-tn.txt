Martell, IT Director, Novaspect division of Emerson Electric Corporation, Schaumburg, Illinois, collaborated with Dennis over the last two years in developing the full range of policies, SOPs and other procedures, guidelines and more for IT, Network, Cyber Security and related documentation requirements.
Nick stated on April 23, 2021, during the project wrap-up / exit interview:
1) All work that Dennis did was excellent and exceeded expectations. Dennis balanced the workload based on designated priorities. He adhered to all requirements and provided scheduling, organization, research, creation, writing, editing, and electronic delivery. More than 200 documents were completed. A particular note of mention was that the organization of content and writing clarity were superior, creating order out of chaos.
2) The documents were far and above what anyone on Nick's team had ever seen. Thanks to the expertise that Dennis provides, team members were accusing Nick of somehow, overnight, becoming an English grammar and Spelling expert.
3) Nick also remarked that he would definitely use Dennis again, for other projects and annual updates are required.
