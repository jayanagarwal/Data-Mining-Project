WORK EXPERIENCES:
2004 Jaguar XJ8 vehicle Restoration
I rebuilt a 2004 Jaguar XJ8 four door vehicle. I purchased the need parts from four different salvage yards. In many cases I had to remove the needed parts myself from the vehicle in the yard. NOTE: care had to be taken to ensure the parts selected from the salvage yard vehicle’s had not been in an accident. Some of the parts purchased were: an engine, transmission, drive shaft, rear axle, four fenders, and the body. I installed the purchased parts on the jaguar XJ8 frame, I had previously purchased, which was sitting in my back yard. NOTE: Installing the parts on the frame was the easy part, saving the money to buy the required parts was the hardest part. In spite of these concerns, I rebuilt the Jaguar, I am now driving. In fact, it runs so good it is the only vehicle I want to drive!
