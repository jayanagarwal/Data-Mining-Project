Then looked at their Readme documents within the Github documentation. Some of it needed to be corrected from a long time ago. Other parts needed a better tie in with the Document Site. These were mutually used by our customers.
Worked on evaluating various Automation testing applications for use in with a bank. Evaluated Cypres, Selenium and SmartBear TestComplete.

Experience

CSI-Interfusion/ Microsoft Software Technical Writer Feb 2022 - Sept 2022

Worked on various documents created for developers to use inside the Document and Github site for the Speech development. This includes step by step on the document site and making sure they are clear and concise. Various links were not going to the right place or should have been going somewhere else. So I updated the links and cleaned up where they were going to.

In Github I created pulls which allowed me to correct the links and send them through. I also notified the people who work on the document site so that we could update the documents.

There were two Web documents that I was working with one was the basic Education document site. This site had all the step-by-step instructions as well as more advanced How-To-Guides. These documents were not presented in away that was easy for the first time developer who is looking at using the product from a point of view of here is away to get going easily. Then moved into a more advanced phase.

Built a presentation which showed all the problems in both sites where the various documents were not clear and then from that we will redesign both the Document site and the Github site. Some parts of the document site needed to be completely sent back to make this document more easy for a developer to use.

Robert Half/Heritage Bank: Software Automation Testing Aug 2021 – Dec 2021
Researched various software products to determine which one would be the best tool for completing Automation Testing. Part of the decisions had to be based on what would be good for the Developers and what would work well for end users who were non-developers that performed testing in a UAT environment. Products included Selenium, Cypress and TestComplete. It was determined that the product that fit the needs of the end users and testers was SmartBear TestComplete. Included in this product was the ability to create browser loops that would use both Chrome and Edge. As well as being able to write basic functions that would be used to customize the tool for the multiple web environments that it would be used on.

Began working on Automating all basic functions in TestComplete. Created basic functions inside TestComplete and then updated various parameters.

TestComplete works well with on Website Development Testing. It also will allow for Automation Testers to create Website Looping which means that I was able to create one Test and run it on multiple websites. As well as creating wildcards which allowed for doing testing in various development environments.
