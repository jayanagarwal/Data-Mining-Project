I am very much interested in your Proposal Manager position. I am APMP-certified and have been using Shipley for 12 years. I easily handle concurrent RFxs and am expert at structuring and scheduling proposal teams. When Shipley interviewed me last year, they found that not only was I steeped in their principles, but I was also the perfect candidate to be the VisibleThread Champion for Microsoft’s massive proposal team. I am expert at VisibleThread’s Docs and Writer proposal software, and I trained Microsoft’s proposal managers in its use. This software automates many time-consuming parts of the current proposal process and saves significant amounts of time in preparing a proposal. After completing my contract with Shipley in January 2022, I performed a Lean Six Sigma analysis of the entire proposal process from capture through submittal. As a result, I identified multiple areas that waste inordinate amounts of time and structural practices that create opportunities for non-compliance. I eliminated them from the current industry-wide proposal process and have created a new one. Thus, I now offer a streamlined process that guarantees compliance that also (1) cuts out extraneous content,
(2) maximizes the efficiency and effectiveness of SMEs, (3) unifies the proposal’s voice, (4) makes the solution more compelling, (5) reduces the time needed to generate the response, and (6) simplifies the contract administrator’s review of the proposal. Furthermore, this aligns better with Shipley’s proposal management principles than the current industry-wide process does. In addition, after analyzing the proposal capture process and how it should aid proposal management, I developed methods that reduce the amount of time the Capture Team spends evaluating RFxs. This helps the team determine which RFxs best align with the company’s strengths, reduces the amount of time necessary to review them, and positions the RFx to be handled most effectively by the Proposal Team. Thus, I have created a Manual & Style Guide that lays out the new process and make it available for my employer. I have a great deal of experience with DoD, NASA, and other federal proposals. In addition to Microsoft Word, SharePoint, and Teams, I am also an expert with InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Acrobat Pro. Thus, I am a complete resource for all phases of proposal development. Thank you for your consideration!
