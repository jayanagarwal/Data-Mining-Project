Over Thirty Years of experience owning, running, formulating all of the product lines, received a patent in barrier technology, it is still the best non-sacrificial graffiti barrier available on the market.

I run a lab that does research in new earth-friendly coatings. I negotiate contracts with tolling firms, government bids, international companies and write contracts for the company. Authorized to work in the US for any employer
