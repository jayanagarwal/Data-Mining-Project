Maintained 14 training courses (PowerPoint slides, instructor’s notes, and student handouts).
Developed proactive document quality improvement process. Documentation usability research and validation was a continuous and on-going responsibility. Users from the various target audiences were formally and informally polled on their documentation use. All comments, however casual, were subjected to a full analysis process that considered presentation, content quality, detail level, and accessibility. These generated projects of various complexities that implemented approved improvements. Used Perforce and ClearCase to identify bug fixes/updates to be documented. Used Customer Support logs to identify processes/procedures needing additional details.
Saved a multi-million dollar sale to a large Asian business. The company prepared a last-ditch 300 page implementation plan to salvage the sale with poor prospects of success. During editing, global English concepts were applied to the descriptions. All company action items were rewritten to reflect an aggressive commitment to deliver the highest level of service and quality. The strongly worded positive can-do/will-do approach was successful.
Reduced site installation time by 20 hours. Redesigned and reorganized the server and client installation guides to simplify system setup and high availability configuration (8 servers and 25 clients). Reduced document page count from 734 to 215. Eliminated the need for on-site hand-holding.

Redesigned QA test case process. Rewrote and simplified the QA test case library to allow non-engineers to run test cases and report variances from expected behavior.
Documented departmental business processes. Created a department process orientation document with access to an off-line test bed that new hires to get up to speed. Significantly minimized the learning curve.
