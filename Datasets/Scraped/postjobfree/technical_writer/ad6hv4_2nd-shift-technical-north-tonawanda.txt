OBJECTIVE

Presently, I work for SoPark Corporation in Lackawanna, NY on 2nd shift. I’m the 2nd shift Test Technician. Whenever there is a need, I also do assembly work and run 5 different types of wave-solder machines. I’m the only one in the company that is used in this capacity, because of my skill-set. I’m looking for a 1st shift, full-time position with Health and Dental Benefits, starting on the first day of work. My Background varies from Technical writer,,Electronics, Computer repair, Software Development, Physics, Inorganic, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry,Microbiology and computer technical support. I also achieved hands on Mil- spec standard solder certification from Bell Aerospace and Northrop Grumman.

KEY QUALIFICATIONS

Lead designer/Technical Writer.I designed an Antenna and coupler interface that resolve the Homeland Security Emergency Response Communication issues that occurred during 911. At the time, I worked for Sti-co Industries Inc. This technology is also used for natural disasters, and when the President speaks to the nation, by Airport, FBI,CIA, Command Post Vehicles and Emergency Response Personnel through out the United States. This Technology has saved millions of lives!

This design allows agencies to simultaneously transmit and receive 4 or more frequencies on One Antenna at the same time. The importance and urgency of communicating between emergency responders at local, state and federal levels in a disaster has been proven time and again. STI-CO® Inter-operable Antennas complement gateway transmission systems during critical incidences, enabling first responders to communicate seamlessly while using VHF, UHF, and 7-800MHz voice and data devices.

Fuel Cell Design: I also designed a technique for stabilizing and increasing the power and current for the fuel cell during pee-conditioning and final development of the unit . At the time, I was contracted out by a company called NanoDynamics Based in Buffalo, N.Y., NanoDynamics announced that in May 2004 that it was awarded a one-year contract from the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) to develop and demonstrate an integrated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack and JP-8 reformer system. Most SOFC systems are designed for much larger applications such as auxiliary power units.

Software Tools:
Inversion Microscope, petri dishes, Electrophoresis equipment and other test equptment that I have built over the years. LabView,Autocad2000,C,C++,Microsoffice,NT,Windows XP,Vista, 7, VISO,Orcad9.0,Pspice,Virtual Instruments Software,LogDNA culture test chambers that I designed over the years.Maple, Mathematica, Mathcad, MATLAB ver.6.5,Simulink ver. 5.0/Hewlett Packard 28S,Ti-92 Plus, Circuit Maker Pro 2000, Tektronix 430/Oscilloscope,8753E Network Analyzer, 8594E Hewlett Packard Spectrum Analyzer and Digital voltmeter.

03/94-09/1999 Motorola, Inc. Elma, NY

Production Analyzer-Failure Analysis Technician, Q.A
Working under the Engineering Thick Film Sensors Department of Motorola increased my experience in troubleshooting and isolating problems in circuits. Failure Analysis- Laser algorithm analysis for PRT & DELTA production lines. This involves complex analysis of failed production parts to determine if root cause was caused by laser or production bad parts at the component level. In either case I must resolve the issue.I use statistical methods to determine if the product meets customer specifications. Methods such as forecasting, spc cpk and guard=band limits. I also did continuous conformance testing on our product. This would include Circuit Nodal Analysis, Voltage transient, Electromagnetic &RFI, Frequency response, thermal shock-air to air, Vibration, Mechanical and vacuum Pressure cycle testing. I was the Engineering, Quality Control,Failure Analysis Technician and resource person for two production lines at Motorola on 2nd shift. Experienced in filing weekly reports, schematics, documentation, customer specs, QS9000 and special training provided by Motorola, Inc.

Hobbies
h
I own a Fuel cell Provisional Patent and a approval date for the Utility Patent for the Fuel Cell Technology that I invented. I’m also a Biochemistry Researcher and Designer.I perform Numerous Bio-Chemical, DNA, RNA and Genetic Engineering experiments on a daily basis. I have done additional research in drug bio-synthesis, formulation, culturing, isolating, Identifying, characterizing, categorizing a library of variety of Cancers, Lupus, Skin diseases,bacteria, yeast and fungi. This research will help scientist be able to find out herbs or drug effectiveness on cancer patients and modify gene expression at the molecular level, by creating the right drug or herbs that target cancer cells. I use Nano-board technology in my research, pipelined with Matlab and Mathcad along with Genetic software on both Mac and Windows base computers for molecular analysis and Drug synthesis.
