I am writing on behalf of my design and development team. We have a staunch belief that project delivery in time and within budget is all about teamwork. In addition, we are glad to assist you project-wise, so you do not have to select an individual and teach him/her for some months before they tackle the job. In the light of this, why not considering us?

Not to beat around the bush, I am shedding light on who we are. Our agency was established as a design studio. However, we have noticed that our designs had trouble being accurately developed by third parties, that is why we launched an iOS department which consists of selected developers, headed by a CTO. Their area of skills includes but is not limited by Swift 3, Objective-C, RESTful, and SQL. In addition, we have a QA engineer and back-end developers that guarantees a delivery of an end-to-end app.
We are proud of having worked with such companies as Zaelab, Ribbet, Caspio, SwiftyBeaver.

To demonstrate our works, I am attaching some links to our portfolios.
First, there is a vast compilation of Tubik’s design solutions on Dribbble https://dribbble.com/Tubik. Besides, we have successfully launched own application that is available to download for free from iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/ua/app/toonie-alarm/id1091330520?mt=8.
To recap our experience, we have published a free book entitled 'Design for business’ https://www.producthunt.com/posts/design-for-business.

We would be glad to work with you and create some outstanding apps together!
