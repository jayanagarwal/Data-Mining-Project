A recent immigrant from Ukraine, with professional credentials in Ukraine, Russia, Sweden, and Israel, I am proof that it really is a “world-wide web”. As a UI/UX designer and instructor with experience in dashboards, web sites, mobile apps, social advertisements, prototypes, wireframes, brandings, presentations, and CMS, I pride myself in staying up to date with the latest design trends, tools, and best practices and being adaptable to new technologies and design methodologies. I’ve learned that strong communication skills - in any language - are essential for presenting and justifying design decisions, and I am eager to begin collaborating and contributing with other team members to create dynamic web-based applications in my new home.
