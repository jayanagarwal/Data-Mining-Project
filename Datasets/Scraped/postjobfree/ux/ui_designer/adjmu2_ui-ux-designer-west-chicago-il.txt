I am a forward-thinking front-end designer offering a unique combination of creativity and
analytical skill for desktop, web and mobile applications. I can assess both vantage points simultaneously for an effective balance of visual nuance and sound business decisions which are easily transferable into a variety of positions.
I have experience working with teams to brainstorm and whiteboard concepts. I can create wireframes at varying levels of fidelity, and enjoy developing style guides and prototyping ideas. I have some front-end coding experience and enjoy working with developers to build ideas out. INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE
