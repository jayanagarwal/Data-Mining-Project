TOOLS
I am still a student in university and currently an
UI/UX designer intern in Designer Journeys of
Tadidi Company. Beacause I desire to earn more
experiences in design, I will try hard to learn and look forward to looking for a job. In addition, I used to work as a part-timer in Family Mart so I think I can get a mindset in analyzing the requirements of customers.
