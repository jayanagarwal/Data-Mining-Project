Cover Letter
Dear ma’am/ sir.
My name is Ta Anh Thu.
While studying Design Studies at RMIT International University with majors in UI UX and Graphic, together with my teammates, I was chosen as an ambassador of the Major and had artworks featured in the RMIT Showcase in 2023.
I have worked and received positive feedback from many customers in different fields such as:
1. Media publications Design: standee, banner, backdrop, flyer, infographic, brochure, light box.
2. Social Media Design: logo and graphics posted on social media websites such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms.
3. Branding and re-branding for start-up companies. 4. Design User Interface (wireframe, low-med-hi prototype). 5. Research behavior, personas, loop, and usability testing. 6. POD Design: T-shirt, strap, case, stationery.
7. Research, brainstorm, and discuss with customers. 8. Work closely with the team to plan the project efficiently. I believe that my qualifications, skills, past work experience, and deep love for the job will enable me to contribute to the success of the company.
My CV is attached for your consideration, and I hope to have the opportunity to discuss them directly so that you can get to know me better.
Thank you for your time.
Best regards,
Thu Ta
