UX/UI Designer - Santé Circle Health - Toronto, ON - July 2020 - present (Part-time) UX/UI Designer - Sign R Us - Toronto, ON - Sept 2019 - Dec 2019 (Contract) Audited and redesigned company website with the goal of increasing conversions and points of sale. Designed and developed a new ordering system that allows site visitors to upload their own assets into industry speciﬁc templates (for example: Real Estate A-Frame Signs) and submit them for print, then for delivery/pickup. Ultimately giving site visitors the ability to submit their orders online dramatically increased overall site trafﬁc and brought in new customers from Google searches and social referrals.
UX/UI Designer - Santé Circle Health - Toronto, ON - Nov 2018 - Sept 2019 (full-time) I was brought on board to create a new application for Santé Circle Health called SAM (Self-Start Accommodation Management). The application’s goal is to automate the process of getting medical clearance for workplace accommodations ultimately getting rid of the communication gap between management and employees.

Engager Rings is a native app and promotional website that connects people to jewellers who help them design and create a one-of-a-kind custom engagement ring. UX/UI Designer - Ours to Bear - Toronto, ON - Oct 2018 - Nov 2018 (Contract) I was brought on to create both a branding package and client facing portfolio website that would serve as the face of the company. Ours to Bear is a digital consulting agency that focuses on bridging the gap between well-known brands and creative youth. They hold events and fundraisers that both promote brands and give artists the opportunity to showcase their skills in creative challenges and art displays. One such event was with Mercedes-Benz’s Remix Project. The challenge was to create a song using only noises and effects recorded from a G-Class Wagon
(shutting the door, revving the engine, doors locking chirp, etc.). This project was more on the UI side with plenty of high-resolution images, effects, and animations. UI & Graphic Designer - United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) - Ottawa, ON
