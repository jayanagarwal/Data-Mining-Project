Dear Hiring Manager,

I will be relocating to the Bradenton, Florida area on (or around) November 1, 2020 for reasons of family matters. I am seeking a career position that offers a working environment conducive to learning and longevity.

Though my current employer is wonderful, I will not be able to work remotely as they are an onsite company, so I am seeking new career opportunities (remote or onsite in and around the West Florida area).

I have in-depth experience with Mobile-First SaaS Web Application UI/UX front-end design/development as well as working with eCommerce Enterprise Management Systems (CMS). I am well versed and experienced in the full Web Development Life Cycle (WDLC) within a DevOps/Agile team environment.

Please review my resume/CV and my relevant UI/UX Front-end Designer-Developer experience that correlates to roles within your organization.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Matthew Maurer
