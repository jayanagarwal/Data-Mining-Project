Overview
Bonjour!
I am a visual experience craft enthusiast, always eager to work on everything under the sun in terms of design! I have been into graphics and user interface designing for the past 4.10 years. I believe front-end design is not only about delightful UI components, but also about how they function for their target users!
I want to help businesses not only sell their products/services, but also to design satisfactory user experiences (UX). I believe that a top-notch UX is a crucial factor in gaining and maintaining long-term business partnerships. Year(s) 1.3 1.7 1.10
