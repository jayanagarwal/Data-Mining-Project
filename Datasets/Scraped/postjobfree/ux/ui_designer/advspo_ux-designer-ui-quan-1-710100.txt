About M e
I am a fourth-year student at Nong Lam University as an English Language and Linguistics student. I have less than 1-year of experience in UI/UX design and have done 2 team projects about applications on mobile. I believe myself as a hard worker, a good listener, and a reliable person. I always try to learn everything new in each project I work with to improve my design ability better day by day.
