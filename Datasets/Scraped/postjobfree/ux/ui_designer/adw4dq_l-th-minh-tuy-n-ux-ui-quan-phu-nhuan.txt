Minh Tuyen Le
I love enhancing more knowledge about
designing as much as I can everyday, so
beside ARENA school, I self-study in my
free time too.
My goal is working in a team of design
or being led by senior designer, where I
can grow as a strong staff and present
my best performance for the company.
