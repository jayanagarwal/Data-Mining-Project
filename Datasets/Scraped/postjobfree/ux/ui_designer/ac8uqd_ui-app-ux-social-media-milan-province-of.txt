Hello,
My Name is Annie Joseph and I would be very interested in An opportunity to work with you, here is a little bit about me...
I have had the opportunity to work in various department and develop my skills in web and app ui/ux design, social media marketing, branding, 3D, product design, photography, design research and development, graphics and so on. My experience enables me to understand, develop and execute a project from start to the end with a simple and streamlined solution where strategy and design are interwoven.
I am able to take on the responsibility of the position immediately, and have the enthusiasm and determination to ensure that I make a success of it. I am a workaholic who works hard and pays attention to detail not because I have to but because I love to. I'm flexible, quick to pick up new skills and eager to learn from others. I also have lots of ideas and enthusiasm that will come with me.
Enclosed is my CV and portfolio. Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Annie Joseph
