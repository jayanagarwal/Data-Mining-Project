UX PROJECTS
Surely - Mobile App
-Designed a dating app prototype to address a number of issues surrounding users' concerns with safety, as well as frustrations regarding poor responsiveness experienced on other apps. This prototype included a user-centered rating system, providing users the ability to submit safety and responsiveness ratings for previous matches. In addition, a feature that allows users to share profiles with, and message friends, enhanced the safety aspect and provided a space for users to share date details with others.
-Worked in a small team as well as individually to conduct user research, which included interviews, affinity diagraming, feature prioritization, user flows, sketching, wire-framing, usability testing, and technical and aesthetic iterations. In addition, our team collaborated on design decisions such as graphics, imagery, color palette and typography. Releaf - Mobile App
-Designed an original mobile app to combat work-induced stress and its effects on employees, both at work and outside the office.
-After a number of interviews and extensive brainstorming, the goal was to provide a solution to help users reduce stress and relieve some of the frustration and anxiety that accompanies it by suggesting preference-based, stress-relieving techniques to complete during short work breaks.
-Worked in a small team collaborating on every aspect of the design process from beginning to end. Thoroughness was key throughout this project as we focused on utilizing the feedback from our interviews along with usability testing to ensure a final prototype that was clean, functional and, most importantly, purposeful. Friends of Refugees - Website Redesign
-Redesigned a local nonprofit's website geared toward empowering refugees through volunteer-based programs. This responsive redesign was done with volunteers in mind, as past users stated the website, which was centered mostly around volunteer opportunities, was disorganized and sparse. Users stated they would have liked to see a coherent presentation of volunteer programs, as well as more testimonials, to help them determine their level of interest in volunteering.
-Worked in a small group with the intention of creating a design that would evoke a feeling of acceptance and community through warm and hopeful imagery, a soft color palette, and a clear depiction of volunteer programs and opportunities.
-Design process included card sorting, attention to information architecture which was altered to provide easier access to volunteer information, as well as a change in typography, making the website more accessible to non-English speakers. CERTIFICATIONS
