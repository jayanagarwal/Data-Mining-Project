Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a Los Angeles-based UI/UX designer, and I am interested in applying for the UX/UI Designer position. Please find my attached resume for detailed information about my background.

With over 13 years of experience in UI/UX design, I have worked on award-winning projects for Fortune 500 companies as a senior interaction designer in the agency. I have also worked as a lead UI/UX product designer in-house, led the creation of corporate offshoot brands, developed brand identities, understood business requirements, conducted user research and competitor analysis, created mobile-first and responsive corporate websites and full-scale iterative designs, and met WCAG2.1 A and AA-level accessibility requirements. I take ownership of the end-to-end design delivery process, ensuring excellence from strategy to completion. Additionally, I implement impactful digital marketing strategies to fortify brand positioning.

As a UI/UX designer committed to user-centered design, I manage the full design lifecycle from conceptualization to detailed UI implementation. I am skilled in gathering and evaluating business requirements, performing user research, and analyzing competitors. I also manage feature implementation, conduct usability assessments, and iterate on design solutions based on data, feedback, A/b testing, and project requirements to ensure that the end product aligns with user needs and business goals.

I am proficient in leading UI/UX design tools such as Axure, InVision, Sketch, Adobe XD, and Figma. I can adapt to any tool preferred by the team. Figma has become my primary tool for building and maintaining design systems and component libraries, creating and testing interactive prototypes, and team collaboration in recent years. I am proficient in utilizing project management and collaboration tools such as Jira, Asana, Click Up, Notion, SharePoint, and more to foster effective Agile team collaboration. I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including stakeholders, business analysts, project managers, and dev teams, to align each project stage with strategic goals. This involved smooth handovers to dev teams for accurate implementation.

Apart from my experience in UI/UX, I can create visually appealing infographics to visualize data and deliver impactful interactive presentations using Keynotes, PPT, and Google Slides to enhance competitiveness. With experience using Adobe CS software for over 20 years, I consider myself an expert.

The clients I have worked with in the past include The Edge Treatment Center, The Forge Treatment Center, Royal Canin, Nitto, Mitsubishi, Kaiser Permanente, GE, Amgen, Merck, Florida Power & Light, Magic Leap, CenturyLink, T-Mobile, etc. My passion is to design solutions that prioritize user-centered experiences and positively impact people's lives.
