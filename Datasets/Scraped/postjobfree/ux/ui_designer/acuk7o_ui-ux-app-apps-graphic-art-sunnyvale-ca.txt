Recent Experience
Tivo, August 2014–August 2015
Contract UI/UX Designer
UI/UX Designer in the Set-Top Box team. Responsible for several areas of upcoming and future UI, including Settings, Help, Messages, and Management, as well as related issues around 4K Video Output, Channel Scanning, Saved Search, and accessibility. Also involved in partner projects, and with the larger picture of the UI, as part of the department. Produced mockups, wireframes, menu workflows, and flow charts, as well as the spreadsheets, study decks and concept decks to organize all of that information for use by other teams. Worked with members of the design-communications, product, release management, engineering, and overseas dev teams.
NimbleCat/Throng, February 2002 Present
Art Director/App Co-developer/Director of Marketing Graphic/product/UI/UX design for mobile apps, web apps, and Facebook apps, brand strategy and product roadmap. Copywriting and editing, developing art assets, HTML/CSS. Co-developer of Throng mobile app at all stages. Throng is available on both iOS and Android, and has been through several major iterations based on user response. Started with initial written exploratory concept outlines to examine differences between mobile applications and desktop programs, and where our underlying NimbleCat analytical technology could have an advantage. Proceeded to wireframing sketches and writeups, sequential detailed UI mockups, and finished redlines, plus all art assets. We have been through a series of releases, and went to “flat” design before Apple, to make Throng’s design leaner and more useful.
Also responsible for brand identity, collateral, event materials, and presentation art. Attensity, July 2010 September 2010
Freelance UI/UX and Graphic Designer
Freelance UI/UX design for Twitter analytics product, starting from clients’ basic specs and initial wireframe sketches, and producing concept art, then finished mockups for all product areas, detailed redlines, and all art assets, ready for engineering. I was brought in to provide an outside designer’s viewpoint on their product design.
Stratify, August 2005 October 2009
Graphic Designer
Responsible for all in-house corporate graphics and advertising, plus updates to the user interface of the web-based Stratify Legal Discovery™ service. A number of features were added during this period, and more were on the roadmap, so the product UI needed to be reorganized at several points to improve usability without radically changing the underlying, conservative style. Kovair Systems, Inc., July 2000 October 2001
Graphic Designer
Tasked with creating all mockups, icons, and art assets for the UI of Kovair’s enterprise product. Used mockups to demonstrate that an entire section of the product spec had to be re-written, and helped solve the underlying problem, which emerged from the multiple possible interactions of users with differing levels of access and possible activity within the system. Education
BS Stanford University, Product Design Engineering. Three years study of graphic design at San Jose State University. Accepted into Graphic Design program by portfolio review.
