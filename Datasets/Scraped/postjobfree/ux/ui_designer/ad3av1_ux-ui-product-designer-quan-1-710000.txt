I graduated in the major of UX/UI
Designer from the Graphic Design
Department at University of
Architecture Ho Chi Minh City. I
have +2 years of experience
working in the field of UX/UI
Design. I am an enthusiastic person
and loves the freedom of creativity
at work. Besides, I have good
ability in researching and creating
a case study for a project. I am an
extrovert and easy to adapt to new
environment, but I am also quite
short-tempered in some special
cases. My vision is to make my
clients happy and satisfied.
