In a two-week DMZ Hackathon, I designed a digital
platform that provides farmers with innovative
avenues to the market and cashless shopping
experience for local shoppers during the COVID-19
pandemic and beyond.
I designed a mobile platform that facilitates social interactions, allowing users to discover new places based on preferences, geo-location, and crowd-
sourced recommendations including reviews,
stories, and blogs.
Upon research, I created a mobile app with a team
of 4 that provides students at University of Toronto with time-efficient, reliable, and crowd-sourced
information to locate campus space accommodating
multiple needs.
