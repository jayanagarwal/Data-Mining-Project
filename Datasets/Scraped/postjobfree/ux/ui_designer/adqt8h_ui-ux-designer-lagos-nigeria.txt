Quizin
Quizin is an app that helps its users get recipes based on their current location, the culture in the location, and ingredients available in that location. This product was designed due to the following reasons:
- The large number of tribes in Nigeria ( over 100) and their distinct food tastes and needs
- It would also allow people from other tribes and countries know what’s in the food they get from the locals
- Gives you the ability to cook with ingredients that would originally be foreign to you
- Helps provide a list of food and ingredient prevalent in a locality
