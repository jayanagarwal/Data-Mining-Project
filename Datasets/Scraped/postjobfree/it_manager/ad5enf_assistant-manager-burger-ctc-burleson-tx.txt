I am currently working at the Burger King on Wilshire Blvd in Burleson, Texas as an Assistant Manager . I have several responsibilities including inventory and data entry at shift close entering into the system supporting documents for update of the following day. Leading a team of workers all with the same mission in mind. To complete and serve delicious meals to satisfied customers. As well as keeping a clean and tidy store for an enjoyable experience with Burger King. Adhering to all PPE and all safety rules in order to run a safe and productive shift. But I am looking for more better paying position and or atleast full weekly hours for my financial well-being. I've owned and operated my own small residential cleaning business. Working with and supervising a small crew of cleaning techs on job sites ensuring a satisfied customer experience. I was employed with Tuttle and Tuttle Trucking as head of the human resource department in 2008 and 2009. I had all sorts of duties assigned to me including but not limited to processing applications, safety training, drug testing, issuing safety equipment, renewing permits and the task of leasing on Owner Operators and their employees to name a few. So I thought I would add to my resume this information for your consideration. Also to let you know that yes I would like to be considered for the position. Thank you for your time and consideration.
