Dear Hiring Manager,
I’m currently looking for a job in my field where I can best be utilized, my wife is a Hospice Nurse and will be relocating to Florida soon, so I find myself looking for a job around where she will be moving. I love my current job, I have been with Andrews Sports Medicine for over 13 years, and I have built this position into what it is today. When I started with Andrews the position was new and had just transitioned from a third-party in-house tech to a staff IT Manager. I have supported three EMR systems, two PM systems, two PACS servers, and administrated physical and virtual servers across up to eight locations with WAN connections. I have administrated four phone systems over my tenure some physical and VOIP. I administrate RingCentral with Mitel phone hardware, adding phones and changing IVR menus and call queues. I support Dell SonicWALL Firewalls, and HP switches by installing them and changing their settings. I used our third party to set up the firewalls and VLANs on the switches. I work with the vendors to get the lowest price on hardware and communication services and support. I configured an MDM server to manage our fleet of IPADS to track and lock down their application capabilities. I administrate VMWare 6.5 host servers with 25+ production servers, I have created servers from the installation software and (P2V) a physical server as well. I’m a seasoned professional person who is punctual and a team player. I can be a part of a team or an individual building a team. I enjoy working with computer hardware and have a customer service background where I’m able to talk to the end users on their level. I can work remotely or on-site and don’t have any issues with light daily travel. Thank you for considering me for this position, I look forward to hearing from you. Samuel Harris
