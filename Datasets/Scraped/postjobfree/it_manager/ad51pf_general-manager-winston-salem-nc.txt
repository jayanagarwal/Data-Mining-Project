EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS
Teaching and working with students at the college level has provided me with experience in strategic planning and curriculum/program development, understanding effective time management and multi-tasking skills, as well as how to work effectively and efficiently in an autonomous environment. I have also gained valuable experience working closely with diverse populations in terms of age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socio-economic status to name only a few.
My experience not only as a head athletic coach, but also as a general manager of a business in the private sector has honed my skills in such areas as team building, leadership, management/supervision, accountability, responsibility, dependability, making difficult decisions through critical thinking processes and being adaptable and versatile in every aspect. COMPUTER SKILLS
As part of the current curriculum of the associate degree that I am pursuing in Computer Programming, I have developed proficiency in Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Outlook). I have also attained basic computer coding, programming applications, and logic skills (Python, Java, C++, Swift, PHP), basic understandings of computer network and security fundamentals, HTML/CSS, and computer operating system and device foundations. I have also gained familiarity with Jira software as well as GitHub and effective usages of each. JOB EXPERIENCE
