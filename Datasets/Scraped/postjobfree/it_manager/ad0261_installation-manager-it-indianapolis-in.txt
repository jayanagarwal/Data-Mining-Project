Hello, I’m interested in the job opening you have for installation manager, I’ve been in construction and remodeling since 1997 and it’s about time I hang my tool belt up and try something different. Something that can be challenging and rewarding. I know quite a bit but I’m not closed minded to think I can not learn anything new. I’m not upload a resume because I’ve been a residential contractor my entire career. If there is adequate compensation and a good working atmosphere, I would be grateful for the opportunity to meet with you and talk further.
Thanks,
Shawn Burford
