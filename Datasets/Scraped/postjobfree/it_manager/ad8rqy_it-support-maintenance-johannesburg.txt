OBJECTIVE
In my career I have established what my key strength is, which is dealing with
people, and being able to fit more into my day than most people can. The reason this is the case is because my personal and professional life are based on the following simple principles:
Knowing myself,
Planning ahead,
Welcoming the unexpected,
Developing meaningful relationships,
Finding a mentor,
Getting involved.
My objective is therefore, to continue to implement these principles, in whatever future positions I may be engaged in, as I believe that these principles are the building blocks in carving out a successful and fulfilling career. EXPERIENCE
