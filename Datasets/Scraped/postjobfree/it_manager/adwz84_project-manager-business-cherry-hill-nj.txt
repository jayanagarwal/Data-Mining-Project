CAREER EXPERIENCE
Independence Blue Cross, 100% Remote (Contractor) 01/2023 -04/2023
Senior Project Manager Business Solutions PMO Professional Services
Contract through Intepros Consulting
(Clarity, TEAMS, SharePoint, Microsoft Office Suite, Agile Environment, Waterfall Project Artifacts)
Supported IBC's Business Solutions PMO Professional Services. To avoid internal competition, IBC is migrating off the EnGen Platform onto a new, cloud-based NextGen Platform. The State Based Exchange Project was a partial clone of the Consumer Enrollment Project, sharing the same project charter, stakeholders, status meetings, and most of the requirements. These 2 projects worked jointly to align IBC, On/Off Exchanges, and the new back-end systems. As over 75% of these projects’ features were the same, the Business directed that the projects be merged to minimize confusion and duplication of efforts. Contract ended 04/06.

Supported AmerisourceBergen’s Enterprise Architecture during the Application Rationalization Discovery project, working closely with Accenture in conducting an application rationalization assessment to help AB standardize business processes to enhance customer and employee experience, enhance business capabilities, unlock value by taking out redundant processes and systems and establish operating model that simplifies Application Lifecycle Management. Managed 7 Sprints, 3 of which were complex (Order & Revenue Management, Distribute & Manage Inventory, Customer Service & Support & Marketing & Selling) and 4 standard (Legal, Risk & Compliance, Provider & Clinical Management, Manage Financial Resources, Manage Human Capital, Manage Information Technology, Manage Performance, Pharmacy, Patient Needs, Manage Knowledge, Sourcing, Manage Data & Analytics). When the project timeline was jeopardized in August due to lack of Business participation, I persuaded AB and Accenture to restructure the project, giving Business resources sufficient time for their analysis by starting data collection immediately rather than waiting until the start of each sprint. Developed tracking tools to proactively address potential issues with key resources that would impede project progress (monitored meeting attendance statistics for nearly 200 stakeholders across 290+ meetings). Project completed on time and under budget, deliverables included an Application Inventory and recommendations for which applications AB should consolidate, modernize, or decommission.
