Frank J Dittmar profile picture
Executive Director at KCI
Bill is an exceptional leader with a strong combination of business acumen and technical expertise. As one of my direct reports, Bill needed only minimal direction from me with even the most complex and critical tasks. I had complete trust and confidence that he would always make the correct decision. Bill would be an important asset to any programming organization.
Danny Lee
Technical Project Manager Lead at USAA
I have worked with Bill for over 3 years on a multi-year, multi-million-dollar project. The project spanned a large cross-functional organizational with many development teams and 3rd party resources. Bill was the primary architect for establishing the framework of the project, how the tracking and reporting would be done, and establishing processes such as a change control process. Bill worked with all levels of the organization from developers to senior executives.
By any measure, the project was a huge success and delivered on the intended outcomes. Bill gained the respect of all involved in the project and he played a critical role in getting the project successfully completed. Bill's knowledge of the project, his skill and knowledge as a scum master, and his ability to communicate important and timely information all contributed to the successful conclusion of the project. I can personally attest to Bill's skills and abilities, and I would highly recommend him for any IT or business effort.

EDI / Financial Analyst - Supervisor, CSM
I have known Bill Shipley for the past 19 years and have had the opportunity to work with him in several different capacities. As a co-worker, Bill has proven himself as the go-to person, one who can be depended upon to provide business solutions in very difficult situations. As a manager he has demonstrated strong leadership abilities while fostering a strong team environment. I have seen him overcome several overwhelming obstacles. The one that I would like to highlight is the challenge Bill had with turning his current team from a lackluster group to a highly motivated, inspired team driven to meet and exceed the expectations of his user base. Bill is the consummate professional that can accomplish anything he sets his mind to. Given the opportunity, Bill will succeed. WILLIAM SHIPLEY Page 5

Contracting Officer, Defense Health Agency
It is both an honor and pleasure to offer a formal recommendation for William “Bill” Shipley. As a Senior Program Manager for the HQ Air Force Services Agency, I have known Bill for approximately 1.5 years. Bill joined our organization as a senior level Program Manager. Demonstrating an incredible initiative and a strong dedication, he showed his abilities to lead teams and provide hands on research that propelled a stagnant Bowling Program for the Air Force into the next level. Bill leads by example and many people here find his enthusiasm and dedication both inspiring and motivating. As leader of multiple integrated product teams, Bill has worked hard to build authentic relationships with his counterparts. His efforts have created more productive and results oriented teams. What I find most engaging in Bill's character are his wide-ranging interests outside of programs. He can be quickly engaged in an in-depth discussion on a variety of subjects from intricate math problems to financial markets. Bill's broad range of interests speaks well to his potential as researcher, both in bringing a wide range of theory to the research at hand, as well as carrying forward new hypotheses of interest to researchers. I believe Bill exhibits many of the qualities that are essential to business managers. I highly recommend Bill Shipley for any position and know that you will consider him as great an asset as my organization does.
