SUMMARY:
IT Manager with expertise in maximizing computer user efficiency and satisfaction by increasing the efficiency and motivation of support personnel. An in-the-trenches management style built on experience in all aspects of Information Technology. Leveraging teaching abilities to empower all levels of support personnel and end users to resolve frequent issues and escalate others. This may seem simple or even obvious, but the lack of establishment of trust and meaningful communication between end users and support personnel is the reason that most IT departments are ineffective.
