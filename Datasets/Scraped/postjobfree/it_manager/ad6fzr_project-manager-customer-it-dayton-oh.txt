PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Sales/Miscellaneous June 2020 – June 2021

Attempted my hand at sales in the insurance industry. Took the course and got my license. Learned that sales was not in my future. It was a great learning experience, but I did resign and allow my license to lapse.

After months of not being able to find a job, I “retired” Not where I want to be. To fill the gap and just have a reason to get out of bed, I took a position with Kohl’s. There, I worked Customer Service and cash register. I resigned from that position to seek something more meaningful.
