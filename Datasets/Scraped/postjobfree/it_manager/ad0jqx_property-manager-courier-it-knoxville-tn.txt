Hello, My name is Shaun Samuel and have several years of delivery driving experience, particularly with Roadie(a UPS Company) With a class D w/ F-endorsement.
I have several thousand miles, 4 service badges, all with a five star rating. (proof available upon request). Not only do I drive but I am a master of many trades where I am a Property Manager/Real Estate Investor. So, I understand and know how to deal with people both in harmonic and stressful situations, thus being an excellent P-T Associate for the NAPA Team. I hope to be of service to you. Have a safe and fantastic day!

Best,
Shaun Samuel
