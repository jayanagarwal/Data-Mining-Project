Having dedicated my career to professional training and education advisory, journalism, writing, and IT administration, I have accumulated experience in supervising teams and meticulously managing schedules and programs to foster growth and excellence. Over the years, I have developed a deep understanding of the unique challenges individuals face in these industries and the importance of personalized guidance in navigating career paths. While I have thrived in the realm of professional training, I have increasingly felt drawn to a more direct role in supporting individuals' career development. Transitioning into a career counseling field allows me to combine my passion for mentorship with my expertise in guiding others toward fulfilling and meaningful careers. I am excited to leverage my diverse skill set and industry knowledge to empower individuals to identify their strengths, explore new opportunities, and achieve their professional aspirations.
