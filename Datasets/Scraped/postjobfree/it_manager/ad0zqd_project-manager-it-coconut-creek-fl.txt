BBVA Bancomer Mexico Aug ’12 – Aug ’15
Position: Regional Design and Developement Manager, Mexico City, Mexico
Project: Assist Implementation and BIG Data project creation

In charge of the implementation of Assist system for Houston agency, and the application of technology with Big Data architecture for Anti-Money laundering area.

Using Mongo, I ve created a function that simulates Oracle s JOIN, since in Mongo join function doesn’t exist. The process asks for a string, which is used as argument to search for a specific customer in the customer s collection, from there, it takes customer’s number to search into the customer’s account collection, and from there, it takes all the accounts related to the customer and searches for all the movement on the cash collection. It becomes an easy process for the user, the user’s process is entering the customer’s name and the system returns all cash movements done in all his/hers accounts.

Participate creating a process (batch process, which is the reason of using Hadoop) that triggers an alert when a customer s data meets some specific criteria. This means that a large customer file is processed using Hadoop map-reduce capabilities. After the process finishes it delivers a small and manageable set of alerts to the business optimizing the currently existing mainframe process from 2.5 to 1.4 and reducing MIPS

Collaborated on a solution that integrated different technologies to identify customers that are trying to use bank s infrastructure to do money laundering activities, on-line using rabbit mq, rest and oracle for persisting data along with the following technologies:

oLinux
oHadoop
oPIG Latin
oMongo
oStorm
oDrools
