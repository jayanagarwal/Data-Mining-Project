Dear HR Manager:
This letter is to express my interest in your posting on USAJobs for an IT Specialist (INFOSEC) position.
I have extensive experience with implementing all aspects of RMF with the systems of DCMA and also with handling audits since they began at DCMA since 2013. I have been on teams for three different contract companies in previous years handling all aspects of audits and RMF accreditations. I am confident I will be an asset to your organization for those very reasons. It is my focus to ensure DCMA's information remains safe and in the proper control. I would love the opportunity to be part of the DCMA team, a strong, focused, and dedicated team has helped me develop a successful career, thus far.
I hope to help develop your existing team and be a positive role model for security compliance and audits.
Iâ€™ve attached a copy of my resume that details my experience. I can be reached anytime via my cell phone, 804-***-**** or via email at ad4ada@r.postjobfree.com. I look forward to speaking with you about this employment opportunity.
Thank you for your time.
Best Regards,
Beth McCoy
