Morgan Stanley via UST Chicago, Illinois, USA
Enterprise Agile Coach 10/2021 - 10/2023
As the Fleet Coach for the Digital Client Services Product Group, I integrated the IT and Product Teams from E*TRADE with those from Morgan Stanley following MS's acquisition of E*TRADE in 2020. I led E*TRADE teams in adopting the Morgan Stanley Agile Framework, using Lean and Agile concepts to drive desired business outcomes. I designed and implemented coaching plans for individual teams and entire programs as a transformation strategist.
My coaching focused on Scrum and Product Management. Coached multiple teams to show significant improvement and consistently deliver within three sprints or less. I enabled incumbent Scrum Masters, Agile Coaches, and Product Managers to improve their Agile skillsets and embed Agile disciplines within their respective Product Teams’ Operating Models. I was responsible for establishing the Program Increment Planning framework for the Digital Client Services Product Group. This allowed us to prioritize important initiatives and allow stakeholders and customers to promptly consume the value derived from completed work.
Key contributor to the Communities of Practices (CoP) for Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and Management. Ford Motor Company via V2 Soft Detroit, Michigan, USA Agile Transformation Integration Lead / Agile Coach 01/2019 - 10/2021 As the Agile Transformation Integration Lead and Agile Coach for the FEDE Product Group (Ford Engineering Design Environment), my responsibilities were varied. I drove the adoption of the Ford Agile Framework across the FEDE Product Teams.
I established a Program Increment Planning Framework, chaired Program Increment Planning Sessions, and actively led Program Increment Planning Workshops.
Led efforts to identify and/or redefine internal Products and reevaluate how such Products support Enterprise Business Capabilities and Architecture.
I drove an in-depth product taxonomy review, which led to reorganizing the teams within the FEDE product group. This reorganization ensured that the Product Teams were aligned with the correct Products while their corresponding outcomes were aligned with PI Objectives.
I developed and delivered bespoke Agile Training workshops for various groups, such as Product Owners, IT Teams, and Business Stakeholders.
These training sessions were designed to subtly emphasize and market the advantages of Agile adoption, promote an innovative culture, improve service delivery, and ensure effective management of demand and intake operations at scale. Additional focus and tailored training classes for Kanban-based teams ensured they could leverage Agile adoption for flow- based teams and stakeholders to gain support from current employees to transition to an Agile organization. Introduced the practice of aligning the Objectives and Key (OKRs) with our PI Planning Commitments and Deliverables. Post implementation of OKRs, the teams demonstrated a deeper understanding of the Ford Business strategy, which helped improve their working relationship with the Business.

Barclays Vilnius, Lithuania
Director IT 02/2013 - 03/2016
I relocated to Vilnius, Lithuania, in June 2013 to manage the expansion of IT Application Management Service Centre and Infrastructure Services. This move was partly prompted by the geopolitical issues between Ukraine and Russia, and Vilnius was considered an alternative location.
My responsibilities on assignment to Lithuania included the positions of Interim Global Technology and Infrastructure Services
(GTIS) Site Head and Technology Operations Service Director for Europe. Between January 2015 and March 2016, I held the Workplace Innovation and Transformation Director position within the Workplace and End User Experience (WUX) team.
My primary focus was developing self-service offerings through digital channels, such as gamification and social networking tools, for application management and the service desk. While in Lithuania, I also served as the Interim Global Technology and Infrastructure Services (GTIS) Site Head and Technology Operations Service Director for Europe. As the Workplace Innovation and Transformation Director, I led an Agile transformation within the Barclays Investment Bank IT Global Service Desk. This involved training and coaching Development Teams, Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and program- level leadership in Agile Development principles and practices aligned to Disciplined Agile Delivery. Our successful implementation of these changes resulted in savings of £6 MM over three years, reducing the Service Desk's operating cost from £4 MM to £2 MM per annum.
Developed a pricing model based on the number of Service Desk Calls/Interactions (i.e., price per call). This model improved cost transparency for the business and has reduced unnecessary usage of the Service Desk across different business lines. During my tenure as the Interim GTIS Site Head, the site became a leading provider of IT services in Lithuania. The site's accomplishments were recognized at the 3rd annual Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) Shared Services and Outsourcing Awards 2015, where it was awarded the "Shared Services Firm of the Year-CEE" award. This event is dedicated to honoring outstanding performance in the BPO and Shared Services industry in Central and Eastern Europe.
