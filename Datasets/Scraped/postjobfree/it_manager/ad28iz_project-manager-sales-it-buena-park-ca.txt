Mr./Ms. Hiring Manager,
As a detail-oriented, focused, and innovative Operations, Strategy, & Administrative Executive, I offer a strong background in expanding business continuity and overall revenue for small to midsize organizations. Combining key strengths in operational excellence, process improvements, and relationship-building, I am seeking consideration in the role of Director of Operations for 36 N.
With over 25 years of experience in senior management, sales, operations, and technical management, I feel I am an ideal candidate to lead your operations team. I have worked across a broad range of industries. I have had customers from startups to multi-national corporations. I measure my success by the accomplishments of my teams. Most of my career has been focused on startups and fast-growing companies. It is very easy to think startups are all the same, but they are not…they are like gummy bears. While any two might be the same size and shape they have different needs (color and flavor) that makes their requirements as a client unique. I first started working with many startups in the early 2000s with the explosion of the dot coms. Unfortunately, for many of those startups they became known as the “dot gones.” I had many as customers during those years and have worked with many rapidly growing companies since that time.
I am known as a proactive problem-solver with a solid business acumen, capable of navigating complex situations in fast- paced environments. In the past, I have led roles with a wide variety of duties, demonstrating a cross-industry skillset. As an entrepreneur and past COO, I know how to manage the budget, find the value, and build critical relationships. As a leader, I enjoy mentoring and building growth plans for every team member. From the receptionist that has the skills to be the office manage to finding and developing my replacement. I understand and appreciate that this position requires me to relocate to Tulsa. I have been looking for a unique opportunity to take me out of California, I know this is the opportunity I have been seeking. Tulsa has been one of the top cities my family and I have been considering. I feel Tulsa offers a culture and set of values that aligns with ours. Please look past the fact that I have spent my life in California, I assure you I am not the stereotypical Californian. Sincerely,
Scott Morewood
