PROFILE SUMMARY
Solution-focused IT professional with 15+ years of successfully managing Software Implementation, Development, and Integration projects. Experience with both SDLC and Agile and more importantly, knowing when to use each.
With a knack for automation, I specialize in re-designing Project Management organizations to be able to automate workflow and repetitive tasks, allowing the focus to be on problem-solving. In recent projects, I have been able to reduce time dedicated to status collection and reporting by up to 30%.
Looking to channel this experience towards a Director role to be able to influence the strategic roadmap and PMO maturity.

CORE STRENGTHS
PROCESS SIMPLIFICATION
I am a firm believer in the adage "Work smarter, not harder". In everything I do, I try to make the processes simpler and more automated. For my Stakeholders, this has saved them time and effort, allowing them more time for critical thinking. For my PMO, this has yielded a project lifecycle that is faster and more consistent.
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS
Sometimes, you have to think out-of-the-box. Stopping to ask, 'why do we do it this way', often yields opportunities to leverage new technologies or approaches. In my coding days, I rewrote programs to reduce their run time by as much as 90%. As a manager, I look for areas where new approaches can have dramatic effects.
TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATION
As a manager, I never want to be surprised by problems encountered by my team. I encourage them to let me know as issues arise, so I am up to date and able to help escalate and resolve. Similarly, I never want my superiors to be surprised by problems on my project. I make sure that as circumstances change, they remain in the loop, so they can always be up to date on my progress.
