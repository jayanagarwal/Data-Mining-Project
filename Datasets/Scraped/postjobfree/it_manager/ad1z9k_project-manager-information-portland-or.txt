Senior Project Manager/Business Intelligence with 25+ years’ experience in Information Technology. Application experience includes the use of writing, graphics, animation, video and web development tools as well as software development, testing and database tools, ERP and CMS design and buildout.

As a Project Manager I have had extensive experience planning and managing people, projects and materiel both in formal management structures and in more ‘ad hoc’ environments. I have developed my skillset through real world learning and more formal training. I am comfortable working with project members and interfacing with stakeholders at any level.

I have long Enterprise experience creating and running installations and revisions, gathering information from widely varied sources, recognizing stakeholder responsibilities and requirements, analyzing competing priorities within the organization and making effective recommendations for action to any level of enterprise management. I thrive in a multi-project environment and work well across enterprise boundaries to establish priorities and enable operational initiatives.
