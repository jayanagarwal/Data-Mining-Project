Testing in SSF involves the below steps:

There are 4 layers in MES system and coordination happens in between those to take real time decision and know the exact status of production.

Level 0: production unit ( Factory, where the ground level work is being carried out)

Level 1: Sensors are present which indicates different situation and provide signals to next level

Level 2: Process Control is present here which is an automated system that controls everything and takes all decision and pass to lower levels to execute them.

Level 3: MES (manufacturing execution system) is present in level 3 that acts a bridge between process control and ERP. It takes the necessary information from level 4, processes them and passes the processed data to level2 in its understandable format.

Level 4: ERP is present here which contains all the information regarding product like purchase order and its specification and financial details.

Reporting is done by taking data from Level3 i.e MES. A tool called PSI is used to extract data from MES layer and put it in database on which reporting can be done.

Data from source (MES) is being transferred to BI (Business Intelligence) by tool called PSI ARC by scheduling jobs and being kept in tabular format. This is the 1st layer of BI and called as Data Landing Zone.

Then Data from Landing Zone to next layer (Abstraction Layer ) which is the intergradation layer where business logic is applied.

Next layer is the Reporting layer that takes required information from Abstraction layer with the help of different KPIs by using the tool SpotFire.

Testing in Reporting Factory is done basically by comparing and checking data. Here data flows in various stages based on Star-Schema model and then finally reflects on various reports. As Tata Steel is a steel production industry, it has basically three areas: Order, Invoice and Inventory. Based on these areas reports are built. Along with that some based on customer complain and issues also some reports are built. Data flows as below:

Source: Raw data is provided by customer in source tables.

Pre-stage: Data are pulled from source and kept in tables/views in RF (Reporting Factory) end. No transformations are applied in this particular layer.

Stage: Here data clinging activity like removal of extra space, elimination of duplicate records etc are done.

Idas: Here transformations are applied on the stage data based on the requirement. This is the most crucial layer as star schema concept is applied here. Here every Fact table is linked up with different dimension tables and populates data.

Data Mart: Here data flows from Idas and no transformation is applied. On top of this layer, reports are built. So the data which are required for reporting purpose, only those data is kept.

Reporting Layer: Reports are seen in SAP Business Objects tool. User has to click on the particular report, refresh it on the current set of data and can view it.

Ad-Hoc Universe: There is another facility for user to create their own reports based on the objects present in the universe. Here user can just drag the desired objects and see the report based on the condition provided.
