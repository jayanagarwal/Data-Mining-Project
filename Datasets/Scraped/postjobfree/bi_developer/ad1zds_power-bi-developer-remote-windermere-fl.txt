This is a job inquiry for: Power BI Developer (Remote)
Dear Hiring Manager,
I have been working remotely for the previous 5 years and I am currently pursuing a Data Programming and ETL Integrations position with the same work environment. I look forward to implementing my 21 years of experience at a new and innovative company since I was recently laid off from my previous position due to downward market trends in the specific retail sector which prompted my previous company to downsize its workforce. All my automation projects were recently completed, which prompted the company to outsource consultants to maintain the day-to-day infrastructure of the IT Department.
I am currently a Data Integration and Automation programmer with a deep understanding of SQL, Data Mining, and ETL Integration systems, and Data Analysis. I also previously held two supervisory positions for implementing new integrated systems and data flow projects.
I believe that my wide experience in cloud and on-premise data management along with my strong analytical skill set can contribute to your firm’s future goals and expectations.

Sincerely,

Kristian T. Butler
