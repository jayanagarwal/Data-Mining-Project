Data conversion from legacy to new system

• Data mapping: Data profiling, data type conversion, modify legacy stored procedures by write new SQL query based on new logics.
• Stored procedures performance tuning after conversion: Remove duplicates in the upstream temp tables by managing many to many join, stage larger volume data in temp tables instead of CTE/subquery and add index to temp tables.
• Create supporting technical and functional documentation, including data flow diagrams, and provide support for deployed solutions.
• Data validation in reports after conversion: Compare SSRS reports between PROD and DEV to make sure data are consistent after conversion.
• Knowledge using TFS version control
