Background

Michael has 13+ years of IT and consulting experience, including over 11 specializing in PeopleSoft ERP products (since version 5.x). Prior to becoming an independent contractor, Michael was a 6-year “veteran” of PeopleSoft Global Services (PGS) – where a unique combination of technical and functional skills crossing nearly all product lines was applied.

From the technical standpoint, Michael is well versed in all PeopleSoft development tools (AppEngine, PeopleCode, SQR, PS Query, Crystal Reports) and technologies (Security, Web, Messaging, etc). In addition, he has excellent understanding and experience with database systems, SQL, data modeling for both transactional and reporting (both relational and multi-dimensional – ie. Business Intelligence, Cognos cubes, etc.), data warehousing and loading of data (ETL).

On the functional side, Michael began in the Financials area formally trained in accounting and finance, completing up to level 4/5 of the Certified General Accountants’ (CGA) Association. Thus, he is very familiar with most financials-based business processes and transactions. He has excellent exposure to PeopleSoft’s GL, AP, AM and PO modules, and further specialization in the EPM product line which includes Financial Service Industry (FSI) modules such as Balanced Scorecard, (BSC), Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP), Risk Weighted Capital (RWC), Asset Liability Management (ALM) and some Budgeting. Michael also has excellent experience in other PeopleSoft Product lines such as HCM, CRM and Enterprise Portal.

Combining these functional / technical skills, Michael is thus very often considered the “go-to” person on many projects. From the identification of a problem, gap, or enhancement, Michael is able truly understand and analyze functional aspects of the issues, talking directly with end-users to verify and confirm desired functionality and results from a business perspective. When the problem in fully understood in this sense, he then can assist in formalizing the functional requirements and translate those into technical specifications – without there being any loss to functional intent. Finally, Michael is fully capable of working with these technical specifications and building (coding) the solution in a PeopleSoft best-practice fashion.
