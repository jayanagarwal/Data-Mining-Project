PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

LP Corp. (via Robert Half Technology) – Vancouver, WA
Software/Reporting Engineer (June 2016 – Current)
Sole development resource on Canadian Forestry Site Project to re-write/convert several dozen reports to SAP Crystal Reports 2013.
Worked with DBA in modifying Oracle SQL scripts to use relational database model for tables, views & overall improved reporting performance. Several reports required dozens of database table/view joins to retrieve the correct data.
With all the changes, report performance was drastically optimized. Users & Management were very pleased with results.
Lots of requirements gathering, daily coordination on project timeline/status, and testing/data validation with the users and DBA.
Wrote specifications & documented reports in new system. Gathered metadata definitions & added optional display page to each report.
Developed new report standards with guidance from management. Used Crystal sub-report links for standardized report headings, logos, titles & labels that pulled data into reports from database properties table.
With a limited budget for the project, had to be extremely aggressive & efficient in meeting numerous deadlines & timelines for requirements gathering/analysis, various design/development stages & UAT/testing phases.

ADP (via Pinnacle Technical Resources) – Alpharetta, GA
Software/Reporting Engineer (February 2015 – May 2016)
Primary developer emphasis was on Standard Reports of the “ADP Workforce Now” product, as well as support of “Pay eXpert” product.
Support & new development included 150+ Worldwide Standard Reports impacting thousands of worldwide customers in Production environment. As well as many reports in the various stages of development/testing/QA for enhancements and defect/bug fixes.
There was a lot of “support liaison” work involved in this role. It included working with the DB team, various infrastructure groups, product owners, testers & QA personnel, corporate helpdesk personnel, managers & other developers.
Had to become very familiar with full stack of technologies & layers involved with reporting -- from end-to-end.
There were numerous logs to review in Splunk tool, to see when/where/why the report completed in Error.
Lots of multi-tasking involved. A typical day would include receiving several emails & being assigned to new problem tickets from the U.S. overnight India Reports team regarding new Production report issues.
U.S. based team basically consisted of my boss (the Manager of Application & Development) and myself.
Had to utilize good prioritization, punctuality, multi-tasking and lots of troubleshooting focus (with little to no supervision/direction).
On a typical day, besides troubleshooting environment related issues for Standard Reports, attended phone/Skype bridge/online working sessions on a regular basis, multiple daily meetings & daily Agile Scrum Team “Stand-Up” meetings.
Also, could not let my normal development project tasks & deadlines slip for upcoming software patch & major releases.
ADP developers adhered to release, project & development deadlines and worked with the Agile methodologies using the Rally tool -- i.e. User Stories, Defects, Sprints & Releases concepts.
Became U.S. “point man” in managing software open ticket queue in CA Service Desk Manager tool to track Problem Detail tickets.
When arriving at ADP, there were 80+ open problem tickets (along with nearly 400 open software defects). Was instrumental in getting this ticket count down to 0 tickets at one point in 2016 before leaving the company in May. A goal of less than 10 open problem tickets was set, to keep the queue at a manageable number. Was personally instrumental in this becoming the “norm.”
Had to always be aware of the “hot” tickets, track & manage open problem tickets and communicate and give status/feedback to managers and the team when escalation occurred.
“Triaged”/reproduced report issues from end-to-end in Production & QA environments, and used knowledge/judgment to transfer tickets into a Rally system software defect for the Agile Scrum Master to rank/assign.
As a motivated self-starter, also took it upon myself to learn new tasks on personal time.
Learned to export the client’s database from Production & to import (using Unix/Bash script) the client’s database into QA environment for troubleshooting, reproducing issue & ultimately a resolution.
Were many report troubleshooting tasks involved to decipher and fix reporting issues. This included running Crystal Reports with the client’s exact parameters to reproduce the error if possible, reading log files (Splunk), tracing errors & knowing when to involve other personnel/teams (Java developers, Configuration Management, Database, Web Tier, etc.) to resolve the issue.
Accessed Crystal Server console regularly to read error logs, manually publish new Crystal template versions & troubleshoot/fix issues.
Heavily involved in a project to convert many “Standard” reports for clients to “Partner” reports. A Partner may have several Clients, so the data would need to be retrieved & reported for all Clients.
Became the “go-to-guy” on the team for converting the Crystal report templates, modifying SQL scripts & testing based on the new proof of concept for “Partner” report framework.
Helped design a Report Issues “Playbook” in Visio, for both regular Standard Reports & Partner reports, whereby the exact point of failure could be pinpointed in the reporting flow/process.
Created a Reports troubleshooting knowledge base using the Confluence team collaboration software internal website. Common “issues/problems” were logged with a problem, investigative steps involved and a solution. This was a great tool for current & future use, when similar/same problems “popped up” again.
Was very little support, development & report issues troubleshooting documentation when starting at ADP. Documentation that existed was mostly outdated, or in old emails that people had saved. As with the Reports troubleshooting knowledge base, also started a Standard Reports Development Team Support & Training page on the team’s internal Confluence website. Much of the information available was gathered then compiled into single, concise documents and web pages, with troubleshooting steps. This became a great tool for support & also for onboarding new developers.

Hewlett-Packard (via Experis/Manpower) – Boise, ID
Reporting Analyst/Engineer (July 2011 – October 2014)
Led migration of reports for several customers/accounts from legacy system (BRIO) to Business Objects.
Had interactions with multiple HP accounts to understand current and future reporting needs/requirements.
Ensured that each account's reporting solution was migrated & that all requirements were met successfully in the new environment.
Assisted in account-specific reporting & down-stream systems, and provided gap analysis to SRA & helped resolve gaps.
Documented scope, performed gap analysis & resolved the gaps identified and raised awareness on risks to perform risk mitigation.
Extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) data into useable format for the new customer reporting data warehousing system.
Conducted report analysis, design, configuration and customization in the Business Objects Infoview environment.
Executed report migration activities and supported both Customer Acceptance Testing activities (CAT) and Move to Production activities.
Using hard deadlines, performed thousands of hours of Crystal Reports development, troubleshooting & testing to meet customer needs.
Development Web Intelligence (WEBI) reports in Business Objects environment for ad-hoc reporting.
Worked with the testers using HP ALM tool to test the reports & complete the end user acceptance.

Environment was self-directed a lot of the time. Strong teamwork & individual initiative was required.
All of this, while working in an international virtual environment (sometimes, English not being the first language).
