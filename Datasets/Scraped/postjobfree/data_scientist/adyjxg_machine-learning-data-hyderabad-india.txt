BANK LOAN DEFAULT RISK ANALYSIS
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (too risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicant’s using EDA is the aim of this case studies Language used: Python, EDA
Libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. adyjxg@r.postjobfree.com
