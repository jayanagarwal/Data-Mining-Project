Projects
Developed statistical Order-to-Close & Ads recommendations Boston, MA.
• Online Food ordering application around Boston using EDA. Predicted housing prices by ML regression models in Boston, MA. We can conclude that distance for the city does not increase home price and that older home are more likely to have nitroc in them. Use variance inflation factor (VIF), RMES, regression model.
Projected growth trends for Indian used cars.
• Created regression models, decisions tress, random forest andused RMES to build the best model. We can tell that the used car markert is growing in india as the middle class increases.
