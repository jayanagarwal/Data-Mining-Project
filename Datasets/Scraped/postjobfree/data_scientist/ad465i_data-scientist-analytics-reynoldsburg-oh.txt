UCLA / Cleveland Cliffs Steel – MS Capstone Project
Built a binary classification model to predict the occurrence of one of the most frequent quality defects in galvanized steel
Algorithms and methods: Logistical Regression, Ridge Regularization, Cross Validation, Bootstrapping, Class Balancing, Feature Engineering, Quantile Aggregation, Data Augmentation and Standardization, 2-sample t-test
Developed a high performance binary model achieving 80% Recall and identified top contributing process parameters Cleveland Cliffs Steel – Linear Regression Project
Deployed a linear regression model to predict the zinc coating thickness in a continuous steel galvanizing process
Model prediction within 2% of online instrument measurement of coating thickness
Result used to estimate coating thickness when online measurement is unreliable ArcelorMittal USA – Hypothesis Testing Project
Used A/B testing to identify the root cause of transverse subsurface cracks on steel slabs
Results were used to design a field experiment to confirm root cause and remedy the issue WORK EXPERIENCE
