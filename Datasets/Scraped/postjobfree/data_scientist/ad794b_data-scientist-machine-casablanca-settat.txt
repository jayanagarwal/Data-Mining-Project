Projects
Maintenance predictive -brake pad wear estimator
In collaboration with an engineering research entity, the project aimed to develop a highly accurate model for estimating brake pad wear. Data mining was conducted using data from various sensors, and machine learning techniques were employed to predict future brake pad wear. Subsequent testing, statistical analysis, and defect analysis were carried out to enhance prediction accuracy.
Customer Identification Number
The project focuses on identifying regular drivers of a vehicle through low vehicle signals, utilizing connected vehicle data. A machine learning pipeline is applied to define key performance indicators (KPIs) and a model that predicts the number of drivers.
Social listening project for computer brands
Which involved web scraping ON Twitter using the Selenium library, processing and analyzing sentiment using NLP to interpret and classify emotions. Web interface was developed for better illustration. Data Science Field : ML,NLP,DL,Statistics, Computer Vision. LLms Programming : Python Pyspark,R, Distributed Computing.
