PROJECT
Customer Churn Prediction project.
We Collect Big Data from Various Sources.
Perform Big Data Analysis on JUPITER NOTEBOOK.
Then perform Feature Engineering Techniques to Big Data to clean the data and perform Scaling Techniques.
Then Visualize the Data through Tableau, Matplotlib and Seaborn. Then Check the accuracy using Machine Learning algorithms and found its accuracy as 95%.
We use Machine Learning Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Algorithms, Decision Tree Algorithms, Support Vector Algorithms, KNN Algorithms. we also use Hyperparameters to get good accuracy.
we found Random Forest is Best.
