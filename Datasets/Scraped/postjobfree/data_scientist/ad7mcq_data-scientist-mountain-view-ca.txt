Axtria Leading data analytics and cloud software company in the life sciences industry Data Scientist(Decision Science Associate), Berkeley Heights, NJ 07/2023 - Present
●TopicRecommendationSystemEnhancement:
● Addressed the limitations of the existing XGBoost model for time series data by developing a topic recommendation model using RNNs (LSTM, GRU) in Keras-TensorFlow, which improved prediction accuracy, achieving an 80% recall rate and 75% precision, and increased engagement rate by 8%.
● Evaluated the model in PySpark for optimized scalability and efficiency compared to local setups, resulting in a 50% reduction in training time, and conducted SHAP analyses for feature assessments.
● Preprocessed diverse data types (patient data, insurance claims, multi-channel interactions), performed feature engineering and exploratory data analysis, created visualizations, and prepared data for modeling.
●MLOpsPipelineDevelopment:
● Identified inefficiencies in manual ML workflows and communication gaps, developed an MLOps pipeline in Jupyter Notebook integrating feature engineering, model training, and monitoring workflows.
● Leveraged Random Forest for modeling, Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, and MLflow for lifecycle management, reducing deployment time by 30% and improving performance consistency by 20%.
●Non-personal Promotion Optimization:
● Built a robust channel attribution model using XGBoost that leveraged multi-channel touchpoints(calls, display ads, emails, etc.) to quantify the impact of display impressions on total prescriptions.
● Devised a strategic plan for display banner marketing, optimizing promotion levels for each healthcare provider using model predictions, resulting in a 15% increase in prescriptions and a 10% revenue growth.
● Communicated complex analytical findings effectively to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Cayuga Health Partner(CHP) Largest healthcare network optimizing patient care in Finger Lakes region Data Analyst, Ithaca, NY 12/2022 - 05/2023
●Led a capstone project in a team of three to enhance network integrity for CHP healthcare network, leveraging HIVE SQL, Python, and Excel to analyze and manipulate a dataset of over 6 million insurance claims.
●Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless integration of data insights into operational workflows, recognized for exceptional teamwork and rated as a top performer.
●Developed and presented strategies to optimize patient retention to CHP stakeholders, resulting in a potential 10% increase in retention rates and enhanced operational efficiency. Leadbank Technology Leading Fintech company in Shanghai Quantitative Research Intern, Shanghai, China 08/2021 - 11/2021
●Tested convergence of 100 stocks with a 500 stock index using Python to perform RankIC and Yield Spread, resulting in a 12% improvement in predictive accuracy for stock movements.
●Designed a profit-enhancing strategy based on stock index deviation behavior and Fréchet distance, validated using the Roll model, resulting in an 8% improvement in portfolio returns over three months.
