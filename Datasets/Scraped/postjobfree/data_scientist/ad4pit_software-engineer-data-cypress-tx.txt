PROJECTS
NYC Taxi Fare Prediction
Python, Jupyter notebook
• Devised a NYC Taxi Fare Prediction Model
using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Models with an accuracy of 96.68%.
Performed exploratory analysis of data,
selected features, cleansed the data and trained
a dataset of 55 million rows.
Spam Filter for Emails
Python
• Developed a Spam Filter to classify emails as
spam/ham (2005 TREC Public Spam Corpus
Dataset) by implementing Multinomial Naive
Bayes Algorithm. Improved accuracy from
88.3% to 91.8% by applying Laplace
Smoothing technique to smoothen the data.
PAC Man Game
Python, ML
• Implemented generic graph search algorithms
such as Depth First Search, Breadth First
Search, Uniform Cost Search, A* algorithm
with heuristics, Mini- Max, Alpha-beta
pruning, Inference to help the Pac-Man find
routes to clear the food, to find shortest path in a maze and to avoid adversaries or catch them.
Asynchronous Secure File System
C, Kernel Programming
• Developed a Linux based system to support a
secure kernel-level trash directory using
producer consumer pattern. Implemented a
new syscalls and methods in Linux VFS Layer
to asynchronously compare, encrypt, and
delete files.
Deduplication Syscall
C, Kernel Programming
• Developed a Loadable Linux kernel module
that supports a new System call which takes
two files and De-duplicates the files (creates
hard link) if they are owned by the same user
and have identical data.
