International Journal of Logistics Systems and Management Oct 2021
In order to remain profitable, commercial maritime ports must maintain high throughput of inbound vessels. The gantry cranes that load and unload the vessels are the primary point of interaction between a vessel and the port, which cause a critical bottleneck in the process flow. Errors in this segment of the process cause cascading delays which ultimately cause vessel service backlogs, extending to logistical delays in moving shipping containers across land and rail as well. This is to the detriment of the ports, which lose popularity among shipping lines and may even be fined for causing sub-optimal delays. This work expands on prior work in using a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimise the parameters of a fuzzy system which controls port-side resource deployment. In contrast to existing solutions, this resource deployer is able to function online and adapt to real-world faults while still maintaining superior performance as compared to industry practice. Further, proposals to expand or reduce the port-side infrastructure are computed. Optimizing Maritime Vessel Service Time with Adaptive Quay Crane Deployment Through Level 4 Hard-Soft Information Fusion 22th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION), Ottawa, Canada July 2019
Commercial maritime ports must maintain high service throughput in order to remain profitable. One of the most critical operations in a commercial maritime port is the loading and unloading of shipping containers on a vessel (i.e. servicing a vessel) and storing them in the storage yard. A delay in this process would cause cascading delays in servicing further vessels, causing delays in moving cargo across land, rail, and sea. Furthermore, the port itself may incur fines for allowing such delays in their operational procedure. This work highlights a Fuzzy System optimized by a Genetic Algorithm to adaptively control the deployment of quay cranes (and their operators and all other supporting equipment and personnel) to optimize the time required to service a vessel, while simultaneously reducing the operational costs of doing so. Prediction of Container Damage Insurance Claims for Optimized Maritime Port Operations
Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, Canada May 2018
A company operating in a commercial maritime port often experiences clients filing insurance claims on damaged shipping containers. In this work, multiple classifiers have been trained on synthesized data, to predict such insurance claims. The results show that Random Forests outperform other classifiers on typical machine learning metrics. Further, insights into the importance of various features in this prediction are discussed, and their deviation from expert opinions. This information facilitates selective information collation to predict container claims, and to rank data sources by relevance. To our knowledge, this is the first publication to investigate the factors associated with container damage and claims, as opposed to ship damage or other related problems.
