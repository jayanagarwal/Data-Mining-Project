Tiger Analytics Consulting (November, Aug 2023 to till date) PROJECT NAME: Trade Promo Optimization
Worked on: Python, Pandas, SQL, scikit-learn
Trade promo optimization simulator helps clients especially to find out which promo tactic works the best amongst all the promotion levers available in the market. Using Machine learning models to estimate the impact of each of the lever and help to calibrate the base and incremental sales for each of the SKU will help to take actionable insights to enhance the promotional framework. Responsibilities:
• Built end to end data pipeline for the creation of analytical dataset. Incorporating different KPI’s from the Business.
• Performed EDA, feature engineering and feature selection based on considering the business logical and statistical significance
• Implemented framework on Linear and machine learning techniques such as elastic net regressor and Lasso regression based on the characteristics of data influx.
• Driven Business stakeholder calls.
PROJECT NAME: Forecasting Engine.
Worked on: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, scipy.stats, XGboost, lightgbm Helped business to build a volume forecasting engine that helps to forecast the volume servers for both Europe and north America region so that better supply chain and inventory management can be optimized.
Responsibilities:
• Built end to end data pipeline for the creation of analytical dataset. Incorporating different KPI’s from the Business.
• Performed EDA, feature engineering and feature selection based on considering the business logical and statistical significance
• Implemented a comprehensive time series forecasting framework utilizing various techniques including SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous factors), Facebook Prophet, and XGBoost. The selection of techniques was based on thorough analysis and experimentation with the data, considering factors such as seasonality, trend, and exogenous variables. This framework enabled accurate volume forecasting, taking into account complex temporal patterns and external factors.
• Created complex features based on business logic and mathematical functionality that stood among one of the most important feature in forecasting the servers. The Math company (November, 2022 to June 2023)
PROJECT NAME: Cx score ( customer experience score) Worked on: Python, Pandas, pyspark. spark.sql, do-why package, scikit-learn. Customer experience score is used to enhance customer user journey through the website and Mobile application here using Machine learning and causal statistical modelling by implementing DAG ( Directed acylic graphs) feature importance is captured among the pool of levers that can be controlled by business. Responsibilities:
• Built queries using spark.SQL for incorporating the business logics and KPI’s to get quick and meaningful insights from the data.
• Performed EDA using Pyspark as the data size is really large (10 Million rows handled per day )
