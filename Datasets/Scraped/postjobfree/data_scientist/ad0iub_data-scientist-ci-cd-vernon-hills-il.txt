Professional Experience
Data Scientist, Allstate – Northbrook, IL 07/2022 to Till Date Responsible for building Risk (Loss & Demand) analysis models for Housing & Auto Policies. Used GLM/GLM net for Rate Planning. Collaborate in data curation, validation and transformations using Python packages, built models using R on Amazon H2O Servers (while tuning cluster size as needed). Provided recommendations to stake holders with relevant visualizations and interpretations.
Extract data from various sources and run checks for data validity/credibility/quality
Build strategy to transform the data as per business rules and collaborate with other team members for innovative ideas
Hyper Parameter tuning, inclusion and exclusion of variables by backward and forward selections
Compare metrics across iterations while tuning the model parameters as needed
Provide prompt inputs/comments through code reviews for continuous growth & improvement
Visualize modeled variables and interpret them
Make recommendations as needed (including whether the current best practices are good to be used moving forward, or if there is a need to modify best practices) Data Scientist, Abbott, Lake Bluff IL 06/2021 to 07/2022 Responsible for data curation, transformations, and for applying business rules on data, gathering user requirements, documenting design and Unit testing processes. Handled multiple projects pertaining to model building across various teams.
