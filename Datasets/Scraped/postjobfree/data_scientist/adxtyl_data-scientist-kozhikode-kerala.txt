PROJECTS
Recommendation System
Similar Product Finder using Computer Vision and NLP
•Developed a Python-based Flask web application,
Similar Product Finder, for recommending similar
products based on user preferences.
•Leveraged Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques and a pre-trained VGG16 Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model for feature extraction
from product titles, tags, and images.
•Utilized K-means clustering to group similar products efficiently and improve recommendation accuracy.
•Integrated Celery and Redis to handle asynchronous task processing and ensure smooth performance.
•Considered product IDs, titles, tags, prices, and images as features for comparing and identifying similar
products.
•Programming Language: Python
•Machine Learning Models: VGG16, Word2Vec
•Algorithms and Techniques: NLP, CNN, K-Means
Clustering, Cosine Similarity
•Libraries and tools: Pandas, NumPy, Keras, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Gensim, NLTK, Requests, PIL, JSON, Git, GitHub.
•UI: Flask, HTML, CSS
Apple Classification using Deep Learning
•Developed a deep learning model to classify apples as fresh or rotten using images of the fruit.
•Used transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network (ResNet18) on a dataset of Apple images after preprocessing.
•Implemented the model using Python and Fastai,
achieving an accuracy of 97.5%.
•Created a simple Gradle web application allowing users to upload images of apples and get a prediction of their freshness status.
•Programming Language: Python
•Machine Learning Models: ResNet-18
•Algorithms and Techniques: CNN
•Libraries and tools: Fastai, Hugging Face Transformers, Hugging Face Spaces, Pandas, NumPy
•Model Deployment: Hugging Face Model Hosting
•UI: Gradio
