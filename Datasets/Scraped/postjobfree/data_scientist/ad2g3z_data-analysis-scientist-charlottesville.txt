University of Virginia May 2018 – Dec. 2023
Graduate Research Assistant Charlottesville, VA
• Investigated in collaboration with colleagues the use of chemical reactions for faster memory storage.
• Discovered relaxations protocols to overlap Mpemba effect with optimal transport. This can be used to design exponentially faster memory storage devices without sacrificing efficiency at low energy costs.
• Designed and coded algorithms using Mathematical Modelling on various programming platforms to simulate out of equilibrium dynamics of chemical reactions.
• Investigated and identified accelerated heating and cooling in chains of chemical reactions using statistical methods.
• Automated simulations using supercomputing integrated servers to optimize and enhance chemical production.
• Analyzed big data sets using statistical tools, exploratory data analysis, regression analysis and graphical representation to characterize topological behavior using principles of condensed matter physics.
• Introduced a novel method to simulate the time evolution in networks. This method is applicable to any situation that can be modeled as a network like chemical reactions, traffic flow etc.
• Massively reduced the simulation time required for large systems from exponential to linear time (from days to minutes)
• Provided data-driven new strategic insights on quantum level dynamics of biochemical pathways and condensed matter systems through quantitative analysis and statistical modeling.
• Presented the research results at national conferences and in written manuscripts. IISER Pune Jan. 2016 – May 2017
Undergraduate Researcher Pune, Maharashtra, India
• Investigated quantum entanglement across spatial boundaries in conformal-invariant quantum field theories (2d CFT) in two dimensions.
• Proposed a method using Mathematica to calculate higher order correction terms to entanglement entropy at low temperature for a 1-d system.
University of Bonn May 2015 – July 2015
Summer Intern - Awarded DAAD Scholarship Bonn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany
• Studied theoretical existence and evidence of “Dark Matter” at different length scales, its candidate particles and various detection methods.
• Coded algorithms on a UNIX platform using C++ to filter out the background for Indirect Detection of Dark Matter. Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics May 2013 – July 2013 Summer Intern - Awarded SINP Funding Kolkata, West Bengal, India
• Learnt about various Electron Microscopes (TEM, SEM, STEM), their structural differences and their utility.
• Trained to prepare specimens for TEM.
• Used TEM to study crystalline structures
