Data Scientist Machine Learning Researcher
Freelance, Groton, CT [ NLP Recommender Systems Deep Learning ] May. 2023-Present Sentiment Analysis for Marketing via NLP [ Word2Vec SMOTE DistilBERT ]
• Conducted data pre-processing pipeline such as converting reviews to embeddings via Word2Vec method and sampled from imbalanced datasets using the imbalanced-learn package such as SMOTE.
• Analyzed the reviews with a state-of-the-art deep learning technique, DistilBERT, using PyTorch, and optimized the algorithm to match the problem area and to perform well on the validation data.
• Evaluated DistilBERT on downstream task of predicting the positive sentiment assessment, with 66% recall rate, 60% precision rate and 62% f1 score, using sklearn packages.
Recommender Systems Implementation [ BPRMF ItemKNN DeepFM LightGCN ]
• Investigated and evaluated ML & DL algorithms on Amazon datasets containing 255,404 users and items for recommendation.
• Implemented and developed BPRMF, ItemKNN algorithms using Pytorch, and optimized the methods compared with two recommender algorithms (DeepFM, LightGCN), that gained an improvement of 17% in recall and 11% in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Performed hyper-parameter validation with 10-fold cross-validation with recall and NDCG. Data Scientist Data Analyst
Avison Young, Boca Raton, FL [ NLP Data Engineering Tableau Marketing Research & CRM] Oct. 2022-Apr. 2023
• Developed a website Chatbot using JavaScript within the HubSpot platform to boost customer interaction and engagement.
• Implemented an automated ETL pipeline for textual data, streamlining data cleaning through NLP methodologies, such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and spell checking, with Pandas, Regex and NLTK libraries.
• Conducted marketing analytics project that involved conducting customer data analysis and creating a Tableau-based dashboard, equipping the marketing/CRM team with the tools for data-driven decision-making. Data Scientist Research Associate
Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL [ Machine/Deep Learning Geo-information & Image processing ] Feb. 2020-Oct. 2022
• Performed comprehensive data migration, preprocessing and analysis across multiple data modalities, including satellite digital imagery, LiDAR 3D point data, time series sensor data.
• Built robust machine learning (SVM, Random Forest, Regression) and deep learning frameworks (CNN, RNN), achieving high accuracy metrics, such as R-squared values surpassing 0.8 for greenhouse gas emission prediction, MAE less than 1.22 feet for groundwater table elevation estimation, and classification accuracy exceeding 80.5% for vegetation classification.
• Visualized the scientific results as map products and contributed to scientific publications and reports. Data Scientist Research Assistant
University of Florida, Gainesville, FL [ Design of Experiment Statistical Analysis Data Visualization ] Aug. 2016-Nov. 2019
• Designed experiments and performed statistical analyses to assist fabricating the biobased sorbents.
• Utilized statistical analysis (ANOVA, regression, t-tests) to evaluate sorbent performance and optimize fabrication processes.
• Applied descriptive statistics for the analysis, interpretation, and visual presentation of experimental results through charts, graphs, and diagrams using Python Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. EDUCATION
