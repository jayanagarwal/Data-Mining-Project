Data Scientist, UC Davis Health, Sacramento, CA Sep 2023 – Jun 2024
• Developed RAG-based customer support chatbot to enhance query response accuracy and reduce resolution time by 90%.
• Developed a classification model to predict late arrivals/no-show patients, achieving ~80% F1 score. Devised intervention strategies based on ML model prediction leading to a 10% increase in provider-patient facetime.
• Designed & built 5+ Tableau dashboards to monitor clinic KPIs, improving planning & analysis time by 8-10 hours weekly. Senior Data Scientist (Team Lead), Internshala, Gurugram, India Aug 2021 – Apr 2023
• Collaborated with functional heads, finance team, and CEO to develop yearly business projections using SQL and time series analysis from 2019 to 2022, achieving projections within 5% of actual data every year.
• Built and maintained 15+ KPI dashboards empowering analytics and marketing teams to track vital metrics like ARPU, Churn, and CLTV-CAC, leading to optimized subscription-based model and a ~20% increase in revenue.
• Designed and conducted 10+ A/B tests & root cause analysis on key metrics fixing major product leaks and improving user TOFU, resulting in an increase in engagement by ~30% over a 2-year period.
• Built Recommendation Engine to enhance personalization on ATS. Leveraged a pre-trained word2vec model to extract textual features combined with numerical features resulting in an NDCG score of 0.85 and a 11.5% decrease in hiring time.
• Led and mentored a team of 5+ Data Scientists & Analysts on 15+ analytics projects over 3 years, facilitated cross-industry meetups for knowledge sharing & talent attraction. Data Scientist, Internshala, Gurugram, India Sep 2018 – Jul 2021
• Engineered a production grade content-based recommendation model on Python to identify most relevant candidates for job roles, reducing hiring time by ~15%. Utilized a combination of vector-based similarity and heuristic methods.
• Developed NLP (smart reply) model to increase chat response rate by 35%, boosting a platform level engagement. Leveraged LDA to generate labels and a CNN+LSTM+DNN layer for prediction achieving a top 3-accuracy of ~80%.
• Implemented an ensemble tree-based text classifier for identifying messages requiring response, achieving a 20%+ improvement in chat initiation rates. Utilized pre-trained self-attention-based BERT embeddings as textual features.
• Built a fraud detection classifier using BOW and TF-IDF, reducing malicious employer chat messages by 50% and achieving superior inference time compared to deep learning models with similar accuracy. Associate Data Scientist, Internshala, Gurugram, India Jan 2017 – Aug 2018
• Leveraged advanced SQL queries to structure and fulfill key data requirements with less than 5% error rate enabling smooth day-to-day operations across multiple departments and driving informed decision-making.
• Analysis & projection for marketing channel focused on B2B, aiding growth and partnership with 2000+ colleges in India resulting in ~500K monthly user registrations at its peak. PROJECTS
