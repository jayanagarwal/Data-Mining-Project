Data Scientist, AT&T - HBO Max, (consultant) - (Python, LangChain, LLM, AWS, Pandas, Numpy, PyTorch) 04/2023 to Now LLM powered Conversational AI: Personalized virtual Assistant for augmenting User Engagement.
• Transformer based Model Architecture: Developed LLM core using decoder, self and multi-head attention mechanisms and integrated layers for user input for text and voice modes, response and user feedback processes through Rest APIs connecting various content management systems.
• Pre-training and Fine-tuning: Leveraged existing foundation models like GPT for generic conversation scope and augmented it with HBO max specific datasets like user engagement, show transcripts, support logs, and content metadata. Iterated through various cycles of development balancing compute size and dataset size based on Chinchilla’s paper guidelines.
• Prompt Engineering and Langchain: Developed Zero-shot, one-shot and few-short learning techniques to adapt for new conversational domains with low training data for low latency responses using dynamic prompt libraries from LangChain.
• Evaluation Metrics and Alignment: Optimized the model for aligning with ethical guidelines and fair use policies, that also include reducing bias and hallucinations and finding a balance between depth and quality. Achieved a BLEU score of 62 and Rogue score of 80 after multiple iterations. Data Scientist, Spotify - (Python, Spacy, PyTorch, Docker, Kubernetes, GCP, Pandas, Numpy, and Tableau) 03/2021 to 02/2023 Playlist Curation with 91% accuracy using Recommender Systems, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms using PyTorch
• NLP: Developed text-driven playlist models using multiple Transformer-based pretrained and customized NLP algorithms, including Text Classification on news articles, Entity Extraction from song lyrics, and Text Summarization of social blog content, to generate diverse and informative playlists.
• Unsupervised User Classification: Created weekly playlists by employing Self-organizing Maps (SOMs), Matrix Factorization, SVD and other Deep learning based unsupervised algorithms which utilized vector representations of user-profiles and metadata for personalized content.
• Reinforcement Learning: Utilized sophisticated Exploitation and Exploration techniques, combined with an Epsilon-greedy strategy employing multi- armed bandits to optimize the RL based objective function to enable the extraction of actionable insights Improved Podcast Advertising ROI (12%) through Ad Spend Optimizations using classical and Bayesian MMMs and MTA techniques.

NLP Data Scientist, Bank of America (Python, Spacy, PyTorch, AWS, REST API, Flask, Pandas, OCR) 05/2019 to 02/2021 Multi-label Text Classification: Indexing unstructured financial documents with Deep Learning using PyTorch.
• Implemented a multi-label Text Classification to classify incoming customer documents into 15 categories with an ensemble of Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and SVM classifiers using Bag-of-words and TF-IDF, and Word2Vec techniques. Applied Deep Learning algorithms including Transformers, BERT, and its variants, in PyTorch with 96% accuracy starting with a baseline accuracy of 87% with Word2Vec and RNN-LSTM. Enhanced approaches in Data Preprocessing, Hypothesis Testing, EDA, Feature Engineering, Dimensionality Reduction, SMOTE, and Hyper-parameter optimization. Hierarchical Clustering using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for Time Series clustering.
• Created Clustering models with DTW as a distance metric using Tensorflow and Keras with GCP stack, to classify time series distributions of consumption products like music, podcast, and other combinations into clusters so they can be subsequently modeled using specific forecasting models for precise forecasts. Utilized Auto-Encoders for data compression in feature space using 1D-CNN and Bi-LSTMs to enable easy convergence. Data Scientist, JPMorgan Chase & Co. 07/2018 to 05/2019 Credit Risk Evaluation using Alternate Data using Decision Trees and Neural Networks in Python using Scikit-learn.
• Developed a classification model for predicting the probability of default using a fine-tuned ensemble of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks. By incorporating the sensitivity to loss given default rate to systemic risk, the model outperformed the existing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN models by 8% to reach 93% accuracy. Software Engineer, Citibank, India 02/2011 to 01/2016
