I am very passionate about data analysis, big data processing, data forecasting, and data presentation in a neat, accurate way. To become a true data analyst, I must deeply understand the nature of data as a data scientist and I must learn how to become a data engineer to collect, organize, manage, and convert raw data day by day. I want to dig into accessible data to get it right insights and to get the best reporting that delivers the best performance for the company. Experience
