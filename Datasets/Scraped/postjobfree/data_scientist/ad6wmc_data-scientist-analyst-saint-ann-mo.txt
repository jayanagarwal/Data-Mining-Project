Duties, Accomplishments and Related Skills:
In the capacity as an Application System Analyst/Programmer, my job duties entailed, but were not limited to, designing, coding, testing, debugging, documenting and maintaining interfacing in the Unity Health environment. In additional, providing technical on call support to the company’s Health enterprise computer systems. These legacy systems transferred data by using a standard messaging protocol on Sybase Neon System. Some of the enterprise clinical applications:
• Robot
• Theratrac
• Radnet (billing)
• PharmNet
• PMM
• McKesson
• Meditect
• Cerner
• Allscripts
• Medexter
I was also tasked with managing clinical data records and tracking patient billing data records. Neon was a multi-platform integration engine which supported Windows®, Unix, AIX®, using this integration engine help with displaying, manipulating, and the storage of large amounts of often complex HL7(V3) data records and the support or automation of business processes with the designing and coding on Neon. On or about 07/15/2001, I received professional training at Neon’s training center in Emeryville, CA. I developed Unix bash, ksh scripts on IBM AIX (v4.1) system to automate and monitor many of the tested clinical data records, integrating through the stated clinical applications. When the HL7 data fields could not properly negotiate its entry, in the clinical applications, the HL7 data record files that got hung up at the entrance of the clinic applications, thus my responsibility was to create Unix scripts to automate the process of removing the resistant data record from the process. In addition, that automated process would email the file as an attachment to the business analyst. So, that the business analyst can analyze the HL7 data fields and simultaneous I created a test simulator as a testing tool to assist in testing, debugging and analyzing the fields of that stuck HL7 data record with that clinical application as an Integration System Analyst. It must be noted that each time I performed coding or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) modifications on Neon system. I was responsible for documenting and publishing updated changes to the applications users. One of my major contributions, as an integration analyst was to create Unix scripts on AIX system to evaluate execution script files to ensure properly execution rights on the file so 3/9/24, 9:09 PM Print Resume
