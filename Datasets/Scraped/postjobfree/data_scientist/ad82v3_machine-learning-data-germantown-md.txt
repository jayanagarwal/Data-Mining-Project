Hear Disease Prediction Model
https://www.kaggle.com/code/sarapournourbakhsh/heart-disease-prediction-model In this project I developed a predictive model for assessing the risk of heart attacks. Worked with real healthcare data and leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques to designing and implementing a robust solution to identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events.
• Leveraged 253,680 survey responses from cleaned BRFSS 2015 as comprehensive datasets containing demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical biomarkers related to heart health. Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
• Engineered meaningful features from raw data sources, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family history of heart disease. Employed feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination to identify the most predictive variables.
• Implemented state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting. Fine-tuned hyperparameters using techniques like grid search and Bayesian optimization to optimize model performance.
• Evaluated model performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) through cross-validation and holdout validation.
• Employed model interpretation techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values and feature importance analysis to understand the factors contributing to predictions. Reducing Customer Churn in Telecom Industry
https://www.kaggle.com/code/sarapournourbakhsh/customer-churn?scriptVersionId=188889732 Predicting customer churn for telecommunication companies to be able to effectively retain customers. Large telecommunications corporations are seeking to develop models to predict which customers are more likely to change and take actions accordingly. To complete this project the following steps implemented:
• Preprocess data (convert columns into appropriate formats, handle missing values, etc.).
• Conduct appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights (whether directly useful for business or for eventual modeling/feature engineering).
• Derive new features.
• Visualize data and check for any outliers.
• Handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques,
• Train a variety of models (machine learning and deep learning models) and tune model hyperparameters.
• Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Note that it is more important to accurately identify churners than the non-churners. Therefore, choose an appropriate evaluation metric that reflects this business goal.
• Finally, choose Logistic Regression and Exploratory Data Analysis as the best model based on its performance and interpretability.
• Drawing conclusions — Summary
