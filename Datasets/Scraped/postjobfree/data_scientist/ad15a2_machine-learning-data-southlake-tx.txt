• Data Science: Creating Scope scripts & supporting C# extensions to collect metrics for map data of different sources, developed ETL pipelines to transfer data between different databases, writing java files to collect metrics for open street map data.
• Data Analysis: Creating BI Tabular data model on Azure analysis services server. Creating a set of measures and KPIs to generate reports based on the data model. The model is connected to Power BI Dashboard and then queried from there for presentation purposes. Also, the key performance indicators (KPIs) are important indicator for guiding and evaluating operation and marketing strategies.
• Scripting: Developing java classes that examine geometry of atlas files from open street map raw pbf.
• Outcome: The atlas check java class is merged into the open source project for atlas checks (GitHub). The Scope script will be included into future pipeline for automated computation/presentation. Microsoft (Team Andromedra) Sammamish, WA
Data Scientist contractor (AI/machine learning for Azure Log Data Analysis) November 2019 – June 2020
• Machine learning and deep learning: Creating NLP machine learning models to analyze and classify Azure failover cluster log files to detect anomalies and predict anomaly types. Based on customer analysis and segmentation, we identified types of anomalies to detect, which defined how to collect as well as process data from engineers.
• A/B Testing Experimental Design: Designing different sets of key features to describe the data sets and created A/B testing experiments to quickly collect insights and feedback to improve data models, assist machine learning processes, and guide the overall progress of the project.
• Scripting: Writing SQL server scripts and stored procedures to perform various data driven tasks, creating C# code for Azure functions of web based services, developing python scripts and pipelines for machine leaning models.
• Outcome: The models have been tested for Azure failover cluster log anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and reporting.
