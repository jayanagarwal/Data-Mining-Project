ABOUT ME
As a senior student, I have completed several projects at school in the ﬁelds of Computer Vi- sion and Natural Language Processing. Speciﬁcally, for the CV ﬁeld, I worked on a Virtual Try On project that was submitted and accepted at the "The 2022 2nd ISMODE" conference. Additionally, in the NLP ﬁeld, I worked on a Vietnamese Legal Text Retrieval project that was submitted and accepted at the "ISICO 2023" conference. With a mindset of always striving for improvement, I am always eager to learn new things. EXPERIENCE
Data Scientist FPT.CADS
z 06/2023 – 11/2023 * Ho Chi Minh City, Vietname
Golden Gate Restaurants:
• Analysis and study of big data from restaurant data to create an overall picture for Golden Gate’s restau- rants.
• Research on building and deploying machine learning and ensemble learning algorithms for forecasting.
• Application of machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in Time Series data for each restaurant. Undergraduate research FPT University

• Research and development continued on the Virtual Try-On project and submitted at the conference.
• Research and implement the project "Vietnamese Legal Text Retrieval" and submitted at the conference Software Developer FPT Software - FPT Academy
z 01/2022 – 04/2022 * Ho Chi Minh City, Vietname
• Front-end Web Programming and Back-end Web Programming: In this course, you will learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and server-side programming languages like Java (using Spring Framework).
• Building Real-Time Web Applications: In this course, you will learn how to build real-time web applications using technologies.
PROJECTS
Vietnamese Legal Text Retrieval §
z 01/2023 – 04/2023
• Data Processing: focussing on two main parts. Firstly, it involves standardizing Vietnamese punctuation to its proper form to avoid semantic ambiguity. Secondly, it involves unifying the input method for Viet- namese into a commonly used form, which is often pre-built.
• Retrieval: focussing on analyzing and using the Condenser architecture being Dual-encoder approaches to perform queries combined with Sparse Retrieval, which is BM25, to ﬁnd speciﬁc laws. Metric: F1 Score, F2 Score
• Question Answering: extracting the most relevant information from those laws for users’ queries. We also optimized data processing for training in the two main tasks because legal data requires high precision, but sometimes the datasets used cannot guarantee it, so we need to reprocess them for speciﬁc tasks. Metric: Extract Match (EM), F1 Score.
AI in Fashion - Virtual Try on §
z 09/2021 – 11/2021
• Human Body Parts Segmentation: to detect, extract the on-body clothes’ shape to align sample clothes form for swapping clothes.Deeplab-v2, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet), U-Net are algorithms implemented. Metric: Intersection Over Union(IOU)
• Human Pose Estimation: to detect the keypoints on human body, hence determine the coordinates of clothes, or detect the suitable pose for trying clothes. High-resolution Network, The Spatial Transformer Network are technique used to detect human and estimate poses. Metric: Percentage of Detected Joints
(PDJ), Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS)
• Fashion Landmark Detection: to detect clothes keypoints, incorporate with Human Pose Estimation to enhance determining item’s coordinates on the body
• Inference some recently Virtual Try-on models (in 2020, 2021) to test result and ﬁnd out a way to im- prove the performance. Metric: Inception Score (IS)
