WORK EXPERIENCE
Data Scientist – Revenue Management Solutions, LLC July 2022 – October 2023 Oklahoma City, OK
Identified and implemented an automated solution that resulted in a 72% reduction in errors and a 400% increase in monthly processed claims (from 1 million claims processed to 4 million claims).
• Created a training, testing and validation set of data by labeling the important components of the insurance claim template.
• Utilized SQL and Postgres for advanced anomaly detection in insurance claims, identifying key mismatches and significantly reducing fraudulent claims, enhancing payout accuracy and operational efficiency.
• Improved data accuracy by implementing data cleaning and NLP techniques, including the Jaccard-Winkler algorithm, achieving a 72% match rate in name normalization, reducing manual entry errors, and enhancing data integrity.
• Developed and optimized live data visualization dashboards in Sisense, streamlining the data pipeline to enable real-time monitoring, leading to quicker decision-making and enhanced data integrity management.
• Enhanced database performance by eliminating redundant data and applying common table expressions (CTE) in queries, resulting in more efficient data processing, faster access, and reduced storage overhead.
• Restructured existing queries to update business logic and improved data pipeline to reduce reporting downtime. Data Scientist – Schlumberger Global Energy Services & Equipment – Graduate Research Assistant January 2019 – July 2022 Oklahoma City, OK
Reduced testing costs by $24 million annually by developing a leak rate model using Argon instead of Helium. Company continues to use the model and apply it across along all lines of their business.
• This resulted in an annual cost and time savings of $24 million dollars for testing seals across every product in the company.
• Reduced the cost of acquisition for testing seals by utilizing Aragon instead of Helium resulting in 10x savings.
• Developed an SVR model to reduce the cost of testing seals in oil and gas products used across the company. 2
• Got buy-in from the EPA that Aragon is an acceptable substitute for testing leak rate instead of Helium based on my research.
• Reduces regulatory liability by reducing fines for pollutant exposure. University of Oklahoma - Master’s Capstone Project July 2019 – July 2022 Modeling the decision-making process of auto insurance policymakers to understand the biases in their decision-making process and data interpretation. Introduced a novel way to examine bias by employers from a data science perspective.
• Created a predictive model using SVR, linear regression and neural network to predict the premium of insurance policyholders.
• To improve the accuracy of the model hyperparameters tuning, gridsearchCV and cross-validation techniques have been used.
• Tuned hyperparameters to increase the model’s accuracy.
• Customer gender, marital status, and location have been considered as variables.
• Results show on average, a female who has been divorced has the highest premium value for the company, and it is almost 3.6% higher than non-gender and non-marital status customers on average. EDUCATION
