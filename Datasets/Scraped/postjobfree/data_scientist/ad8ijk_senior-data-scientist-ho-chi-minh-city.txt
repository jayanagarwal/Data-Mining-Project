FPT Software Data Scientist Senior - Onsite
03/2023 – 03/2024
Key responsibilities:
Use smart methods to collect and tidy up data from different places to prepare for making machine learning models.
Create and put into action algorithms and models that use machine learning to solve problems in the business.
Find and fix parts of the data to make the models work better. See how well the models are doing using good ways to measure their success.
Change settings to make the models work even better and predict things accurately.
Put the models to work in real situations, making sure they work well, don't break, and can be fixed if something goes wrong.
Work closely with different teams, like the people who collect data, write software, and run the business, to put the models into what they're doing. Keep up with new ideas and ways of doing things in machine learning to solve hard problems.
