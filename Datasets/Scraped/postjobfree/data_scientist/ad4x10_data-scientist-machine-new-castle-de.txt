PROJECTS
Logistic Regression for SUV Predictions June 2022 - July 2022
(NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn).
• Created a model to predict whether customers will make a purchase based on their age and estimated salary.
• Data cleaning is done by dropping unwanted features and cross-validation is used to split the data.
• Input values are scaled down, and values are predicted using logistic regression which produced an accuracy of 89%. Drowsiness detection using Raspberry Pi Jan 2020 - May 2020
(Raspbian OS, Python 3.6, OpenCV, RPi.GPIO, Dlib, Euclidean).
• The system employs a real-time, non-intrusive approach to monitor the driver's eyes, mouth, and yawning patterns using a Raspberry Pi mini-computer and Python with OpenCV.
• It aims to provide accurate drowsiness detection, alerting the driver through alarms and, if necessary, notifying the owner or authorities via calls or SMS.
• The project's modular structure includes image acquisition, a main processing system with machine learning algorithms, GSM/Calling capabilities, and an alert-raising module.
• With a focus on user-friendliness and affordability, this solution aims to significantly contribute to road safety by preventing accidents caused by drowsy or alcohol-impaired drivers.
