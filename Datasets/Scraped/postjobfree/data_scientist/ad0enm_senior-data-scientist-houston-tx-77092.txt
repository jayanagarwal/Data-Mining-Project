Professional Experience

Sr. Data Scientist Panera, Remote from Houston TX
June 2023 to now

Worked with a group of interns and additional contractors to determine a solution for reducing the number of missing items in café to-go orders. Success would be measured by reduction in number of weekly missing item-based complaints fielded by Panera compared to average numbers seen prior to solution’s enactment.
I also performed a cost analysis to determine how much money might be saved by incorporation of this project through reduction of complaints and subsequent financial appeasements offered to frustrated patrons. I also performed additional data analysis work regarding both appeasements’ numbers and average kitchen order completion times, as well as smaller tasks that arose during the project.

Responsibilities:
•Led the Data Science team of summer interns for the initial stages of the digital-assisted accuracy project.
•Took part in internal Panera Hack-a-thon competition with team, team improvement concept won first prize in our judging category.
•Performed field work/research at Panera Bread facilities.
•Presented project concept to Panera Management along with rest of the team.
•Utilized GCP Big Query to join tables and obtain café timestamp data for a specific set of cafes over the months of June and July 2023
•Performed EDA and analysis on timestamp data to determine average café order completion times arranged by time of day and method of pickup/consumption.
•Classified large amount of Panera renumeration data by type of appeasement utilizing provided Salesforce complaint spreadsheets and access to individual cases to double check numbers and context.
•Utilized the renumeration data to extrapolate annual costs to Panera based on appeasements of customer complaints.
•Utilized GCP Big Query and Buckets to search through unstructured JSON order data from cafés to determine key timestamp information for use in future determinations of average time at quality control consolidation tables in café kitchens, this data can be used to establish average QC time per order as a metric for digital-order accuracy project usage in kitchens to compare against.

Sr. Data Scientist Amgen (Tata Consulting Services), Thousand Oaks, CA
March 2022 to June 2023

Amgen wanted to automate a section of their user feedback dealing with Product Complaints (PC). Specifically, when a complaint is submitted by a user, the respondent must categorize it based on a list of Amgen-reported codes. My team was tasked with querying approx. 3 years’ worth of archived feedback, and then creating and training NLP models to use those case notes and determine the most likely reported codes to associate with new PC input. The three most likely reported codes would be provided to the respondent to choose from, to cut down on time spent looking up reported codes themselves.
My models typically obtained an accuracy of over 90% during training. Amgen stakeholders have been satisfied with the work we’ve accomplished, and the outputs provided.

Responsibilities:
•Led a team of 4 DS, two supervisors (1 Amgen, 1 TCS), and involved in daily team communication via Webex, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet
•Used a variety of NLP methods for text mining, information extraction, topic modeling, parsing, and relationship extraction.
•Developing, deploying, and maintaining production NLP models with scalability in mind.
•Data for models was queried from the internal Bio Connect database using PostgreSQL.
•Utilized PGAdmin 4 and primarily worked on a local virtual machine using Anaconda Navigator and Jupyter notebooks.
•Used Python 3.7.5, TensorFlow 2.7.0, TensorFlow-hub 0.12, TensorFlow-datasets 1.2, scikit-learn 0.23.1 as the code versions.
•Tried to neutralize training data classification imbalances (90% of data classified in top 4 codes) using class weights.
•Used my code as a base for creating output from the models aligning most directly with the interface desires of the stakeholders (three reported code suggestions per input, each attached to relevant dosage form item type and whole number percentage of likelihood among potential code classifications)
•Created multiple successful models for various Amgen dosage forms, models contained between 6 and 15 classification bins.
•Performed extensive data analysis to determine how much additional work the consideration of clinical products might require, and how earlier models that our team created would be affected by this new requirement.
•Presented my findings to the team, and later to Amgen, who agreed with my recommendations and shaped clinical product result expectations accordingly.
•Appended and updated corporate validation documentation as needed during each phase of the project. Worked alongside other departments to complete this task.
•Performed a lot of independent data analysis cross-referencing Amgen documentation to determine which reported codes, item types, and products correlated to each dosage form, to prevent providing inappropriate suggestions in the user interface.
•Designed and implemented a comprehensive knowledge transfer program, resulting in a 50% reduction in onboarding time for new hires.
•Conducted training sessions for cross-functional teams, improving collaboration and communication between departments.
