BERT-based model for Vietnamese Fact Verification Dataset October 2023 - Present Contributed to a team of 6 in developing a machine learning model for fact verification
• Read research papers to figure out the idea to solve the problem.
• Developed the abstract and results section of a research paper. PROJECTS
Stocks price prediction using LSTM March 2024
Analyzed the data and built a machine learning model to predict VIC, MSN, FPT, PNJ stock price changes
• Resampled the data into 1-day, filled the missing data with Time Interpolation method, and performed Exploration Data Analysis on the dataset.
• Tried Moving Average Analysis with 7-day sliding window to predict the prices changes.
• Built a LSTM model with 30-day sliding window and got MAE = 1.37, better than the Moving Average baseline. Tiki Headphone Sales Analysis Feburary 2024
Analyzed the data and built machine learning models to figure out the sales number of a product
• Crawled 634 data records from the website using Tiki’s API.
• Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot the data and find out top 5 best selling brands, average rating by brands, discount rate by brands.
• Built models to figure the number of sales of a product using Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithm. Face Recognition Program March 2023 - May 2023
Collaborated in a team of 2 to design a neural network that recognize faces of Vietnamese with a accuracy of 99%.
• Performed exploration data analysis to find the characteristics of the dataset with over 4000 records.
• Deployed a demo that user can upload a photo to test the face regconition function on HuggingFace platform using gradio library.
