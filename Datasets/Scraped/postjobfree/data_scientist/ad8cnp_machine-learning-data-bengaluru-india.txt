Business Analyst (Data Scientist) – CGRLH Analytics Genpact, Bangalore April 2022 – Present
Responsible to build strategy and architect solutions for Life Science and Health Care Analytics Projects:
• Market Mix Modelling (MMX): Performed marketing mix modelling and ROI analysis to quantitatively estimate the effectiveness and contribution of various marketing elements and developed ML based solution to quantify marketing and pricing strategies for an US-based Healthcare, Analysed the data to find out the key sales drivers, and used various data cleaning and analysis technique to build a Linear regression model and applied various ML Models and tuning methods to enhance the ROI, effectiveness and contribution and propose a budget and marketing execution for the maximum revenue/profit Pricing Models:
o Estimated ROI, effectiveness and contribution from the model was 80%,73% and 62% respectively.
o Presented the data driven business decisions and provided actionable insights and recommendations to the client.
• NLP Implementation for Text Data Analysis: Led the initiative to implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies aimed at enhancing text data analysis capabilities. Utilized advanced algorithms such as BERT, BILSTM, LSTM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest with 95% proficiency to extract actionable insights from diverse textual sources within Johnson & Johnson's project framework:
o Successfully deployed and fine-tuned NLP models, contributing to the improvement in project success metrics through enhanced data interpretation and decision-making capabilities. o Developed interactive dashboards integrating structured and unstructured data, leveraging fundamental statistical knowledge to achieve accuracy in data insights presentation. o Scraped and processed extensive data from US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) Website, ensuring comprehensive coverage and accuracy in text analysis, thus enabling informed business decisions.
• Time Series Forecasting (Healthcare and Life Science Analytics): Led the application of machine learning models, including ARIMA and SARIMA, to predict Care Management Process (CMP) sales growth, seasonal patterns, and trends across healthcare systems, significantly contributing to project:
o Applied ARIMA and SARIMA models to predict CMP sales growth and seasonal trends, significantly improving strategic decision-making in healthcare systems. o Enhanced resource allocation and strategic planning by providing actionable insights into the impact of CMP wins on sales, optimizing healthcare management efficiency.
• Health Care System Sales Analysis: Led the utilization of pharmaceutical data from each health system to predict TRX, NRX, and Medicaid exclude data, achieving a 30% impact on project success by automating data analysis with R, SQL, and Alteryx to streamline processes and enhance efficiency.
• Enrichment of Pharma Data (Boehringer-Ingelheim): Spearheaded efforts to enhance pharmaceutical data quality by automating data fetching using SQL and Python, reducing resource time by ~90%. Successfully transformed and validated datasets like DDD, XPONNENT, and Payor data, converting invalid Healthcare Organization (HCO) records to valid ones, contributing significantly to project success.
PGD Data Science and Engineering
Cranes Varsity, Bangalore September 2021 – April 2022 Prediction of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) using ML (Capstone Project):
• Aimed to predict gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) onset during pregnancy, leveraging machine learning solutions to support proactive identification and resource allocation. The project's objective is to aid healthcare providers in early intervention and risk management, thereby potentially reducing health complications and associated costs. Developed predictive models using machine learning to forecast the likelihood of gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant patients based on historical data spanning several years. Analysed demographic factors, medical history, and clinical parameters to enhance accuracy.
• Used Various ML algorithms like logistic regression, tree-based algorithms like Decision tree, Random Forest, Naive based, XGBoost classifier, web based scripts like HTML,CSS,Javascript. Gender and Age Detection:
• To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture or through webcam.
• Used the Audience dataset, the dataset is available in the public domain total of 26,580 photos of 2,284 subjects in eight age ranges.
• Used Deep Learning (CNN) to accurately identify the gender and age of a person. EDUCATION
