Senior Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer Developed machine learning models to predict vehicle travel times, reducing end-of-route time-of-arrival errors by 30%. Validated models using Google API and GPS data. Implemented and evaluated various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests/XGBoost, and Neural Networks. Identified XGBoost/RandomForest as the most effective models. Optimized 3D object extraction and clustering algorithms, significantly reducing processing time from 20 minutes to 0.5 seconds and clustering time from 2 hours to 3 seconds by leveraging graph algorithms and dynamic programming.
Enhanced efficiency of service docker containers through multi-stage build processes, decreasing build time from 20 minutes to 70 seconds and lowering storage requirements by 30%. Designed a robust and scalable routing engine wrapper API using FastAPI. Managed a comprehensive ETL process involving multiple data sources, utilizing the Polars library for a performance enhancement of over 1000x.
Created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) comprising 10 tables with 5-20 columns each, implementing it in a PostgreSQL database.
