Homemade Machine Learning
Machine Learning
• Implemented and explained the mathematical theory behind Machine Learning algorithms such as: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, k-means, PCA, SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.

Theory
• Notes on mathematical topics that pertain to machine learning including: linear algebra, calculus, optimization, probability and statistics.

Natural Language Processing
• An implementation of a G2P conversion model using sequence-to-sequence neural networks. Given a sequence of graphemes, the model predicts the corresponding sequence of phonemes. The model architecture consists of an encoder-decoder with attention mechanism.

Natural Language Processing
• Several recent end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) models enabling single-stage training and parallel sampling have been proposed, but their sample quality does not match that of two-stage TTS systems. In the work, I will introduce a VITS model for Japanese on pytorch version 2.0.0 that customed from VITS model.
