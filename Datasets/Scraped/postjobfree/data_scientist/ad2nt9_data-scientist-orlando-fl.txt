SUMMARY
A seasoned engineer with an interdisciplinary background in electrical and transportation engineering, I strongly believe in creating inclusive urban cities that prioritize the well-being of individuals, nature, and the community. My prior work focuses on diverse facets of urban transportation, urban planning, active mobility, and sustainability, utilizing data-driven techniques, machine learning, and AI. EDUCATION
Ph.D., Civil Engineering with Transportation/Smart City Focus, (Fall 2022), UCF, Orlando, Fl M.S., Electrical & Computer Engineering, 2016, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV B. Tech., Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 2009, U.P. Technical University, Lucknow, India WORK EXPERIENCE
Mar’23-present Transportation Data Analyst, Insight Transportation Consulting, Orlando
• Working on several urban planning and transit ridership forecasting related transportation projects.
• Conducting data analysis using advanced analytic tools to make data-driven decisions. May’22-Nov’22 Sustainability Intern, Orange County Public Works
• Worked on the Orange County Sustainable Operations and Resilience Action Plan
• Prepared a training presentation and drafted a white paper for Public Works management and staff based on best practices from FDOT, FHWA, and TRB. 2018-2022 Graduate Research/Teaching Assistant, University of Central Florida Research Assistant (funded by SAFER-SIM, a Tier-1 UTC):
• Developed a trajectory planning framework to study active mobility users’ interactions in urban spaces.
• The framework will allow urban planners to test traffic scenarios and thus proactively plan and design safer urban cities.
