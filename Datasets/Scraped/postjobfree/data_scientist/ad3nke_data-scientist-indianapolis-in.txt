• Independently designed a PID control system for a quadcopter drone leveraging MATLAB for simulation and dynamic modeling.
• Innovated in addressing the underactuated nature of the drone (4 actuators, 6 DOF) by devising a motor mixing algorithm for independent control of roll, pitch, yaw, and thrust.
• Integrated and analyzed data from multiple sensors (Ultrasound, Camera, Pressure Sensor, IMU) to accurately determine the drone's state for effective maneuvering.
• Fine-tuned PID controllers for each motion axis, achieving optimal flight stability and response times under varying atmospheric conditions.
• Utilized genetic algorithm to generate optimal trajectories for precise landing and hovering, significantly enhancing the drone's operational efficiency and control accuracy.
