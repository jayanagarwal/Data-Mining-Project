Senior Design Project (Rescue Blankets) [Team of 5] Problem: Create a product that keeps people warm when they get stranded in their car during a blizzard and works independent of the car.
Project: A 12” by 15” by 4” casing with 5 packs of 4 rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that uses a wind turbine, solar panel, and wall wart for charging. The system was able to handle 3 heated blankets and 2 USB chargers for phones.
Skills Used/Acquired throughout Project:
• Data Collection: During our tests, I keep track of all our data that we collected from the test. This included how the battery drained and solar panel power output.
• Graph/Chart Creation: I formatted data into graphs and charts that we’d use in our group’s reports and presentations.
• Knowledge about Renewable Energy: Our project had us use solar panel and wind turbine as a source of power, so I learned more about renewable energy.
• Testing: My team did a lot of testing throughout the project and measured the voltages and currents we needed with a multimeter.
EE3921 Final Project (Yoshi’s Apple Eating Adventure) [Individual] Problem: Make a Project using an FPGA logic, C program, NIOS processor, and 1 on-board peripheral
Project: I made a game like Snake with Yoshi to eat apples placed on the screen and the DE10 Lite was the controller.
Skills Used/Acquired throughout Project:
• Troubleshooting/Debugging: When I discovered an issue with my software, I separated the problem in smaller parts to test my specific parts like my game display or my accelerometer.
• Testing: Every major change in the software I made, I’d test to make sure the game was operating as I intended.
• Creative Problem Solving: One problem I had was that Yoshi would count one apple multiple times if in the range of an apple for too long. Therefore, my solution was to give Yoshi a “speed boost” after getting an apple. This led to the apple being counted once and being an indicator to the player that they ate the apple.
• Pixel Art: Reminiscent of the 8-bit era of gaming, I used grids over images and testing different color codes to create all the sprite.
