Senior Application Performance Test Engineer, Boeing, 05/2011 - 01/2019
• Developed custom code in C/C++ to simulate a variety of conditions
• Collected gigabytes of detailed data regarding application performance
• Used AI (Genetic Search) data mining techniques to extract relevant information
• Modeled and projected the behavior of the application under a variety of conditions using statistical methods on the data collected in the mining
• Presented results to internal and external decision makers and executive leadership teams
Senior Application Performance Test Engineer, JP Morgan Chase (formerly Washington Mutual), 1/2003 - 10/2009
• Developed custom code in C/C++ to create over 100 concurrent, non-discrete simulations recreating production conditions
• Developed an extensive function library that reduced simulation development time by 80%, and increased productivity by 300%
• Created statistical templates to speed data analysis by 85%
• Created parametric model to estimate simulation development time, accurate to 10% Senior Unix System Administrator, Department of IT, City of Seattle, 3/2000 - 3/2002
