As a Lead Data Scientist on the Digital Personalization Team, we spearheaded initiatives aimed at enhancing the user experience through cutting-edge technologies.
The primary focus was on 3 key initiatives:
Smarter Search: Used advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and search engine models, tackled challenges such as minimizing errors in search results and improved processing times. It involved fine-tuning BERT & ELMO models for contextual embeddings, implementing parallel computing and GPU frameworks for faster processing, and enhancing search quality through text normalization and spell-checking.
Smart Provider Finder: Used Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, to forecast the cost of episodes, treatments, and medical interventions. The role involved refining optimization routines, enhancing forecasting metrics, and combining specialties to improve accuracy. Model deployment using AWS SageMaker Studio, Lambda functions to automate CI-CD pipeline, EKS to model registry.
Provider Tiles: Developed a recommender system to suggest services based on user behavior and clinical history. It included analyzing clicks, logs, and demographics to personalize recommendations.
The contributions directly impacted the accessibility and affordability of healthcare for our customers.

Lead Data Scientist
March 2022 – October 2022:
Centene Corporation in St. Louis, MO

Centene is the largest Medicaid-managed care organization in the country and provides a portfolio of services to government-sponsored healthcare programs. In addition to other state-sponsored/hybrid programs, and Medicare (Special Needs Plans), Centene also contracts with other healthcare and commercial organizations to provide specialty services including behavioral health management, care management software, correctional healthcare services, dental benefits management, in-home health services, life and health management, managed vision, pharmacy benefits management, specialty pharmacy, and telehealth services. Centene's current long-term care business data storage/data handling system involved a collection of various Excel spreadsheets. Centene wanted to use NLP to examine text across rows and columns to determine the probability that the text meant the same thing. The example shared by the company showed that there were some medical terms and codes in 2 rows of a spreadsheet that indicated a birth delivery was by C-section and long-term care may be needed. So, they'll produce a report showing the level of probability that the data could be 'the same thing'. And the level of probability would determine which results need human eyes to review. Extreme highs (close to 100%) and extreme lows (closer to 0%) did not require priority review. They want to be able to identify the middle (50%) cases as the ones that need human review.

Data Scientist
January 2017 – September 2018:
Realtor.Com, Phoenix Arizona

I built a predictor that can estimate the price a house will sell based only on the house's location in latitude and longitude. I cleaned the dataset and selected the important features, specifically, I took only the sold price, square feet, and latitude and longitude columns. I converted the latitude and longitude values to radians as a way of normalizing the location data and attempted to use only the location to predict price as well as price per square foot. I also randomly split the data into training and testing, 80% for training and 20% for testing. I then used a KNN regressor with K = 10. This choice of K worked well for both the testing set and the test on outside data. I defined my metric to evaluate the model: the average percent difference of my predictions from the true price value. Using this metric, I found that predicting the price per square foot worked better than predicting just the price. The model was deployed on REST API housed on an AWS EC2 instance.
