Master of Science (M.S.) September 2021 – May 2023
• Field of Study: Data Science
• GPA: 3.668
• Project Work:
• NFL Spread Prediction: Utilized decision trees, neural networks, and logistic regressions to create 3 different variants of a predictive model to advise whether a user should statistically take a bet on the spread that currently exists for an NFL game. The neural network model, which ended up being the best, was ~90% accurate in correctly predicting whether a bet should be placed and the side of the spread that should be bet on.
• NFL Spread Predictor Python Notebook
• Recipe Suggestion Application: Created an application using Watson tools that would interact with a user, collect dietary restrictions and preferences, peruse through a dataset of ~30,000 recipes from Food.com, and return the top 3 best matches based on cosine similarity and filtering back to the user.
