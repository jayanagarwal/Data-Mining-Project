Researcher - Modeling Team Jul 2014 – Jul 2015
Summary
Employ StatArb (statistical arbitrage) strategy to bet on horse racing. The strategy is composed of 3 main functional areas:
- Data: Use raw, transformed, and derived data to quantify race information.
- Model: Train our models to reach the best estimates of parameters.
- Backtest: Generate probabilities based on the trained parameters and mimic real bets. The modelling team was formed by PhD, MPhil, and professional designation holders like me, from background of Stats/Maths/A.I./ActSci. We are responsible for model development, as well as to initiate the 2 other areas’ works. We know the input and backtesting requirements well, thus we are also highly involved in prototype development of factors (data) and betting strategies (backtest).
Tasks
■ Developed and modified machine learning models.
- Techniques: collaborative filtering, gradient descent, neural networks, boosting and bagging, PCA, etc.
- Tools: R, C++, SQL.
■ Built a platform that digests and process factor codes/classes created by various programmers.
- Techniques: parallel computing, OOP in Python.
- Tools: Python.
■ Created factors as inputs for the machine learning models.
- Techniques: clustering, Dijkstra's algorithm, clustering, t-test, Chi-square test, correlation test, etc.
- Tools: SAS, R, Python, Matlab, C++, SQL.
■ Devised investment performance analysis and prediction tools.
- Techniques: truncate distribution, convolution, goodness-of-fit test, etc.
- Tools: R, Matlab.
■ Automated backtesting and coped with the constraints (amount, advantage threshold, etc).
- Techniques: brute-force approach.
- Tools: shell script, Java, R, VBA.
■ Performed scenario analysis for the cases in-doubt.
- Techniques: mainly matrix manipulation.
- Tools: R.
