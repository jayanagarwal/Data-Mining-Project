EXPERIENCE
Business Blockchain Lab - Stony Brook University Stony Brook, NY Data Engineer (Research Assistant) Oct 2023 - Present Technology: Python, PySpark, SQL, Github, Conda
• Transformed and optimized the lab’s database storage with a comprehensive data lake architecture, transitioning from CSV to Parquet file format, thereby significantly accelerating data querying with up to 5x speed improvement.
• Utilized API-driven strategies to efficiently crawl large-scale Bitcoin historical data from various sources to the raw zone in Python, streamlining real-time data acquisition and significantly expanding the capabilities of our data repository.
• Automated ETL processes and integrated dynamic partitioning with PySpark, enhancing query efficiency and enabling targeted updates for specific error dates, thereby improving data flow and substantially optimizing data maintenance. Imperative Execution New York, NY
Quantitative Analyst Intern May 2023 - August 2023 Technology: Python, R, KDB
• Built a Volume Prediction model by integrating the statistical Bayesian method, facilitating clients to execute large stock quantities at optimal VWAP prices, with the new model showing an 80% improvement over previous methods in MAPE metrics, leading to its deployment in the execution system.
• Conducted hypothesis statistical testings to validate the Bayesian model’s results, conclusively demonstrating its enhanced performance over existing models with a 95% statistical significance.
• Optimized stock selection strategy by analyzing both new and existing volume prediction models on the S&P 500 using liquidity metrics, allowing stock segmentation and ensuring the most suitable model was aligned with each stock selection.
• Utilized the KDB database to transform and partition high-frequency tick trading data, resulting in efficient data retrieval and enhancing engineering features for the volume prediction model. VietQuant Hedge Fund Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
Quantitative Researcher July 2021 - July 2022
Technology: Python, R, SQL, Github, Conda
• Achieved nearly 20% improvement in investment efficiency ratio and company’s quarter return by upgrading the portfolio optimization process with statistical Copula simulation models in Python.
• Initiated and automated the portfolio analysis process by implementing the statistical Multi-factor model from scratch and processing raw data from over 100 companies’ financial reports with Python and R, resulting in the successful decomposition of risk factors from portfolio returns and enabling the manager to build a new efficient portfolio with new risk constraints.
• Developed and implemented statistical processing and transformation techniques to detect optimal trading signals from tick and daily trading data, creating single and multi-stock algorithmic alpha in Fundamental and Futures financial markets that contribute directly to the company’s profits.
