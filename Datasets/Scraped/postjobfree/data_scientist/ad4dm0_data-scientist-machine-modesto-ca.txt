• Fluent in exploratory data analysis, supervised (Classification, Regression), unsupervised (Clustering, PCA, Matrix Factorization) machine learning, Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, LSTM, GANs), Natural Language Processing, and Bayesian A/B testing using Python stack (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Sci-kit learn, Statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn, keras/Tensor-flow, NLTK), Spark MLIB, SQL, Postgres, AWS Redshift, and Tableau.
• Experience in leading, mentoring diversified Data teams and working with CxO /Sr VP level business executives EXPERIENCE
Staff Data Scientist / Engineer, Carbon, Inc, Redwood city, CA 2019 – Present
● Developed RAG based chat server to NLP query Invoices, Orders, Shipments Data Mart using Python, Flask, PineCone Vector Database, LangChin, OpenAI LLM API, AWS Redshift, Fine Tuning, Prompt Engg (One shot, Few-shots, Chain of Thoughts)
● Developed various ML Systems viz. Anomaly Detection Model using Scikit Learn on AWS,Resin demand forecasting application using Arima and LSTM models, Developed Printer Churn Prediction ML Model using Scikit Learn, etc.
● Developed various Data pipelines using Python e.g. To Process 1hz sensor data from 1000+ printers and transform and store it into S3 data lake and Designed AWS Redshift Spectrum layer to consume / analyze the data
● Designed / Developed Data Marts in AWS Redshift and Developed Customer 360 Dashboard using Tableau
● Led team of Data Scientists/Data Engineers/Tableau Developers Sr Data Scientist - Hill Physicians, San Ramon, CA 2015 – 2019
● Developed Multiple ML Models viz. Likelihood of hospitalization (LOH) predictive/machine learning model using scikit-learn. It helped in assessing population risk, proactive outreach to prevent hospitalization, and saved about $1 million. Technologies used: Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas, logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forests, Deep neural networks
● Used Natural Language Processing to categorize medical documents using Python and NLTK. The model helped reducing manual effort. Conducted Exploratory Analytics using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib/Seaborn for Member & Provider Data, Segmentation, and Visualization to improve quality of care and cost savings.
