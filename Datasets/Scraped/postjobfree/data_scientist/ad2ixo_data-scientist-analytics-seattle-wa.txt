PhD research June 2016 – June 2021
• Developed spectral metrics that reduced the computational time by over 99% compared to traditional brute force methods. This efficiency enabled the analysis of complex aggregate structures.
• Challenged existing assumptions and provided new insights into the absorption spectrum of pseudoisocyanine (PIC), a well-studied organic semiconductor (OSC).
• The insights derived from this research contribute to the understanding of weak intermolecular forces in OSCs, which greatly impact physical and electronic structures, making them useful in various applications such as optoelectronics.
