The process of drug discovery is complicated and involves many disciplines as they are often bounded by billions of testing, and huge financial and time expenditures. It takes twelve years on average to get a drug officially submitted. The data science and machine learning algorithms streamline and shorten this process, adding a perspective to each step from the initial screening of drug compounds to the prediction of success rate based on biological factors. Such algorithms can forecast how the compound will act in the body using advanced mathematical modeling and simulations instead of the "lab experiments". The idea behind computational drug discovery is to create computer model simulations as a biologically relevant network simplifying the prediction of future outcomes with high accuracy. It allows choosing which experiments should be done and incorporates all the new information in a continuous learning loop. Analogous techniques are used to predict the side effects of some particular chemical combinations.
