EXPERIENCE
DATA SCIENTIST • DATA COLLECTION INFOTECH India Ltd • AUG 2021 To OCT 2023
As a data scientist, my role included designing tasks of a diverse range of computer vision applications, showcasing proficiency in various domains of intelligent systems.
Object detection of traffic signboards (Yolov5)
Object tracking of traffic signboards (StrongSORT, DeepSORT, ByteTrack, etc.)
Text extraction from the traffic sign boards. (EasyOCR, Pytesseract, Google cloud vision API)
Image Processing using OpenCV
Sign pole detection using YoloNAS
Traffic Signal Detection to identify: This project involved the following sub components
oType of Traffic Light (Signalized/ Flash beacon/ Traffic Pole/Railway Pole etc.)
oType of Traffic Arms (Single/Double/Span Wire)
oNumber of Traffic Lights on Pole
oPresence of Pedestrian Signal on Pole
oPresence of Pedestrian Push Button on Pole
For this project we initially experimented with a combination of Object Detection of lights and Semantic Segmentation of Poles, but we got better results with Object Detection of all assets and Post Processing after Object Tracking.
Detection of Road Markings from Aerial Satellite Images:
oSemantic Segmentation of Linear Road markings using (UNet/LaneNet/LinkNet). After thorough comparison UNet model was chosen as it gave us the best results.
oObject Detection of Point Assets from Road markings in Aerial Satellite images (Pedestrian crosswalks, traversals, arrows, merge arrows, etc.). Object Detection of Hatch Acceleration/Deceleration road markings from satellite images using Quadtree Stitched Tile images
oPreprocessing of the tile images using OpenCV and other image processing libraries
Projects using Point Cloud Data Processing
oThe extraction of a Canopy Height Model from PointCloud data in the Virginia dataset using LidR library.
oTree Segmentation and extraction of the tree trunk height and width from LiDAR point cloud data using Dalponte, Silvia, Watershed and other algorithms.
oIndoor Point Cloud Segmentation to classify the building PointCloud data into 13 indoor classes using PointNet, PointNet++ and PointNext models
oOutdoor Point Cloud segmentation of Lidar Point Cloud data for 8 classes using KPConv model by training the model with DALES dataset. Training multiple models of KPConv Model with custom dataset to classify building, vegetation, power lines, poles, automobiles and other outdoor assets.
Prototype of Augmented image generation tool using Generative AI diffusion models
The image dataset used for training the object detection of signboards is heavily imbalanced and certain signboards are represented with very less number of samples. Augmented images were generated using this tool to generate a balanced dataset.

Prototype of Annotation tool using Segment Anything Model (SAM)
A prototype annotation tool was developed based on the segment anything models to generated labeled data with mask images as well as label files in json format.

Annotation tool to generate labels for text in images
A tool was developed using Python using Tkinter library. The user could select a section of image where text is present. On selection of this region, a widget with input textbox would popup where the text could be entered and this would crop the selection section of image and save the image with the text entered as name of the image. These images were then used to train a Siamese Network to identify the text in the image.

My role in DCIL involved client interaction to perform requirement analysis, exploratory data analysis, effort estimation, interaction with the annotation team, validation and verification of the annotated data, selection of backbone architecture, selection of pre-trained weights, hyper parameter tuning, training, validation of training results, inference on the unseen data, analysis of the results and post processing.
PROJECT MANAGER • INFOSYS LTD • MARCH 2011 TO OCTOBER 2013
As the Project Manager of the development team for the mWallet project, my role included Client interfacing, Requirement Analysis, Design the Architecture of the Modules, Staffing of the development team, Effort Estimation, Mentoring, Version controlling, Good Quality and Timely releases, interaction with partner teams, third party interface teams (Bookmyshow interface, Utility bill payment interface etc.)
MWallet product had multiple modules interacting with each other, server and 3rd party interfaces to service the request obtained from the user. The user could send request from different channels namely web, sms, USSD and mobile application to perform financial transactions.

As an individual contributor, I actively participated in the design, development, and implementation phases of the My Favorites feature for the mWallet product. Meanwhile, as the project manager and development team lead, my responsibilities extended to overseeing design processes, ensuring the refinement of deliverable quality, and facilitating seamless interactions with clients, partner teams, and testing teams to ensure timely project deliveries.

To foster continuous improvement and keep the team abreast of the latest technologies, I organized monthly training schedules. Additionally, intra-team knowledge transfer sessions were conducted regularly to equip all members with the necessary skills to address any potential issues effectively.

Key Responsibilities: Design, Development, Code Review, Client Interaction, Interaction with Partner teams and internal teams, Effort Estimation, Staffing, Appraisals
