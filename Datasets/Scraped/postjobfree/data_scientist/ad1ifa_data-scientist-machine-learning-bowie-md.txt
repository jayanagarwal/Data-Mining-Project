EXPERIENCE

Senior Data Scientist --- Tata Consultancy Services July 2021 to Present
(Machine Learning / Natural Language Processing --NLP)

Projects:

1---Tata Consultancy Services: TCS / FedEx Corporation, USA July 2021-2023
Shipment Performance Visibility Software and Visualization / Dashboard Reporting System

The web system allows FedEx corporate customers to track / monitor package shipment status online, with the ability to observe shipment problems especially shipment delays visually through a Microsoft Power BI dashboard and reports.

As the project data scientist with expertise in data visualization, I was able to enhance the system by building predictive models using machine learning (Randome Forest, Queueing models and Monte Carlo simulations – all executed using Python and KNIME Analytic Platform, as well as Microsoft Azure ML Studio), also interactive dashboards using Microsoft Power BI, and optimization.

As a result, customers were able to predict delays based on shipment routes, carrier type and logistics, day of the week, time zone, package attributes such as weight, volume and dimensions, barcode info, etc. Furthermore, end-users of the enhanced system were able to perform what-if analysis visually and interactively.

2---TCS / CS&I (Internal Research / Experimental POC 2021
Machine Learning Predictor of International Demurrage In Supply Chain Management.

The International Shipment Demurrage Calculator — is a binary classifier machine learning system for calculating the probability of shipping delays as well as financial penalty (demurrage). This 92% accurate calculator used shipment data, including ports, routes, vessels, commodity types, dates, etc. to predict the likelihood of delays. Developed using KNIME Analytics Platform and Excel data, and Random Forrest machine learning models. Generated interactive Power BI dashboards for end-users to easily apply the models, and perform what-if analysis through data visualization and reports. Created data models using SQL connection to Microsoft Azure, including cross-tabs, drill-through, etc.

Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical, July 2020 to July 2021
(Janssen Biotech, Inc), Horsham, PA

Senior Data Scientist

Project Objective: (based on NLP, machine learning algorithms and healthcare data sources)
1. Predict physicians most likely to prescribe a newly approved drug over well established brands.
2. Predict marketing slogan / message title most likely to get attention / response from physicians.
3. Predict communication channel most likely preferred by each physician (LinkedIn, Text, Phone, Office Visit, Email, Printed letter).

Project Overview
Johnson & Johnson has successfully secured the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market three of their newly developed drugs:

1, Xarelto blood thinner, used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots.
2. Tremfya used to treat psoriasis, a skin disease.
3. Darzalex used in the treatment of certain types of cancer.

These drugs are new, and unknown to thousands of physicians who are already prescribing well known popular brand drugs. The challenge was how to precisely identify ready and willing physicians who, upon marketing introduction and value proposition, are most likely to prescribe a new brand over existing well known ones. This would likely minimize marketing and advertising costs at least, and potentially boost revenue.

The Company’s leadership believed it might be possible to maximize sales and revenues of these new drugs by leveraging data science specifically, machine learning, deep learning, and advanced analytics. Thus, this project was initiated.

Data Science Goals --- based on historical data:

1 Identify the characteristics / demographic attributes of potential brand-switchers:- physicians who are most likely to switch from an existing brand, and prescribe a totally new drug for treating the same illness.
2 Rank the effectiveness and persuasive power of various messages and marketing slogans sent to physicians by company representatives and marketing field agents. Identify most compelling messages.
3 Identify and rank physicians preferred communication channels:- email, LinkedIn, text, office visit, FaceBook, Twitter, WhatsApp, phone call.

My Direct Contributions

1---Working with stakeholders and marketing experts to set goals, identify data needs and data sources, understand and document products end-users and method of deployment including modeling cycles.

2---Studying relevant healthcare databases including NPI (National Physician Index), FDA public databases, UCI-ML Archive (University of California Machine Learning datasets, models, visualizations, and reports).

3---Working with big data engineers and other data scientists to integrate data from disparate sources Including AWS Redshift, S3 buckets on AWS, data generated locally through PySpark code, Excel data.

4---Acting as the main project Scribe in writing and coordinating code and documents using BitBucket, JIRA, and Confluence.

5---Working on a daily basis with data science tools including: Dataiku, Jupyter NoteBook, Python packages,

6---Developing machine learning models using popular Python packages: NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, matplotlib.

Successfully developed Markov Models for computing differentials in weblog data pre / post marketing campaigns and deriving data-driven channel attribution, rather than based on traditional assumptions.

Lead Data Scientist / Senior Statistician November 2016 to March 2018
(Fraud Detection / Cybersecurity Anomaly and Outlier Analyses)
U. S. Census Bureau / U.S. Department of Commerce
Suitland, MD

Company / Project Overview:

U.S. Census Bureau, in preparation for census 2020 which would be the first census ever to implement Internet-based and mobile phone response to census questionnaire, is developing a machine learning fraud detection system to intercept potential census response fraud coming through cybersecurity breaches and attacks. With annual $400 Billion federal funds to be allocated to states / counties / cities on the basis of population counts there has always been the potential threat of widespread robot / machine generated forged / fraudulent census responses. The fraud detection system under development has three components:

Machine Learning (binary classifier) scoring engine for assigning census responses into fraud / non-fraud categories based on risk probabilities and a predefined threshold, (2) Natural Language Processing, NLP, applied to social media data (twitter, reddit, facebook) to detect potential forums relating to census anomalies / fraud (named-entity recognition, document clustering, topic modeling, document classification, and sentiment analysis), (3) Census response data validation and anomaly detection using probability computations, statistical hypothesis testing, pattern recognition, GIS and topological data analysis, and time series analysis.

As principal data scientist working on this project my role included

1 Collaborating with Infrastructure and IT department in setting up statistical / predictive modeling development environment on Amazon Web Services, including EC2 and S3 buckets, installing open source tools and configuring user accounts and privileges for R-Studio, Python, TensorFlow, GIT-GITHUB, PostGresSQL RDBMS, KNIME Analytics Platform, SAS Enterprise Miner.

2 Writing modeling strategy document, recommending and defending the CRISP-DM model to upper management and providing mentorship to junior data scientists and managers with less familiarity with machine learning, NLP, and CRISP-DM concepts.

3 Simulating census fraud data by collaborating with census experts in identifying data which violate census response rules.

4 Procuring social media data (twitter, FaceBook, Reddit, Instagram) through web APIs as well as third party tools including Sysomos & IBM Watson.

5 Writing code in R / RStudio and Python (NumPy, Sci-Kit Learn) to train and evaluate machine learning models for detecting fraud. Comparing different algorithms and model parameters for best performance based on Recall, Precision, AUC / ROC curves. Experimenting with Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regressio Learning, Nearest Neighbor, k-Means.

6 Performing natural language processing of social media data for potential census fraud detection using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, bag of words and tf-idf document term matrix representation followed by document clustering (k-Means) and document classification machine learning (SVM and Neural Nets).
