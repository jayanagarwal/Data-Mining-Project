Tech Intern, X-Era Realty, Jacksonville May 23 – Aug 23
• Automated email workflows using Google Apps Script for X Era Realty, a commercial real estate company.
• Assisted in CRM setup and optimization to enhance Data organization for X Era Realty. Research Assistant, University of North Florida, Jacksonville Feb 23 – May 23
• Developed a Computer Vision based iOS application to detect, measure the dimensions and classify various indoor 3D objects such as floors, walls, windows, etc., using ARKit.
• Deployed the application using Unity and Xcode for a Construction Project carried out by Prof. Vamsi Sai Kalasapudi. PROJECTS
Diabetes Prediction
• Conducted data analysis, cleaning, and feature engineering to develop a diabetes prediction model using a Random Forest Classifier, leveraging demographic and lifestyle features such as age, number of children, gender, smoking habits, and location to estimate diabetes probability.
• Deployed the model on Heroku, incorporating HTML and CSS within a Flask web framework for seamless accessibility. Image Classification
• Traditional ML Models: Utilized ensemble methods (LightGBM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving accuracies between 46-52%.
• Convolutional Neural Networks: Designed and trained CNNs with varying layers, filters, batch normalization, max pooling, dropout rates (0.3 and 0.5), and ReLU activation. Achieved an accuracy of 87%.
• Transfer Learning: Employed ResNet50 for transfer learning. Preprocessed data by resizing and one-hot encoding. Achieved a 97% accuracy after 3 epochs, using ReLU for intermediate layers and Softmax for the output layer. Car Price Prediction
• Conducted comprehensive analysis of car price data, addressing missing values and outliers through data cleaning techniques.
• Applied advanced feature engineering methods, including VIF calculation and PCA, to prepare data for linear regression modeling, resulting in a highly accurate predictive model. NLP Fake News Classifier
• Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the news title, involving stemming and pre-processing to convert text into a bag of words representation using Count Vectorizer.
• Naïve Bayes’s MultinomialNB and Passive Aggressive classifier models are later used for training and predicting fake news.
