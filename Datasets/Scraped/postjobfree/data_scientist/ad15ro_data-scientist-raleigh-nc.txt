EDUCATION
2018 - 2023 Bar Ilan University, Israel M.Sc in Computer Science. 2010-2014 Ariel University, Israel B.Sc in Computer Science and Biology. KEY PROJECTS
● Developed from scratch Convolutional Deep Neural Netwok (CDNN) for medical image enhancement include embedded guidance layer for tiny details refining. Developed loss function oriented to recognize and sharp spinal structures in X-ray scans. The results are then evaluated on Tone Mapped Image Quality Index (TMQI), Tenengrad criterion, Entropy and LPC-SI metrics.
● Developed a medical image preprocessing method that enhances image contrast for more efficient learning. The method is based on the weighted least squares filter (WLS) and image arithmetic operations.
● Build a model to detect network threats through time series analysis. The model analyze network traffic as time serias by considering each network packet as a data point collected over time. The model based on unsupervised LSTM model is trained to capture the underlying structure of normal instances in the time series data. The discrepancy between the reconstructed (calculated by MAE loss) time series and the original input serves as the anomaly score for each instance. To classify instances as anomalies, the system introduces a threshold on the anomaly scores.
