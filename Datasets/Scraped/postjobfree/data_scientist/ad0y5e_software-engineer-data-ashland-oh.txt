I am also pursuing a master's degree in data science and analysis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I learn from worldclass faculty and peers. I am interested in exploring the intersection of data, communication, and media, and how they shape our society and culture. I hold a PhD in communication and media studies from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, where I conducted research on cinema, movie reviews, and digital platforms. I have published several academic papers and articles on these topics, as well as working as a copywriter and a communication advisor for various organizations.
With a bachelor's degree in computer science and an associate's degree in data science, I have a strong foundation in programming, statistics, and machine learning. I have also worked as a software engineer, a database administrator, a technical lead, and a business operations specialist for different companies and sectors, gaining valuable experience in agile development, project management, and problem-solving. I enjoy collaborating with diverse and talented teams, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and techniques. I am also the creator of a thriving tech community with nearly a million members worldwide, where I share my knowledge and insights on data and technology.
