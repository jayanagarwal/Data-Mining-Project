PROJECTS
Generative AI Ed Tech System: I developed an AI-powered personalized learning platform that utilizes machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). It monitors students' progress, identifies their strengths and weaknesses, and generates customized content. It improves learning efficiency, reduces achievement gaps, and alleviates teachers' workload.
Optimized CHD Prediction ML Model: I optimized a machine learning model to predict the onset of coronary heart disease with a 92% recall rate. It helped healthcare professionals more effectively detect and prevent this serious health condition.
Designed SUD Readmission Risk Model: I created a machine learning model that was able to forecast the probability of SUD patients being readmitted within 30 days from their initial discharge. The model achieved an AUC score of 0.85, which indicated its high level of accuracy and reliability.
Formulated EHR Data Pipeline: I created a pipeline for processing EHR data of patients with liver disease. The pipeline improves diagnosis, treatment, and management, enabling healthcare professionals to extract relevant data from EHR quickly and accurately for better decision-making and superior care.
Developed Liver Disease AI/ML Model: By utilizing advanced data analytics and feature engineering techniques, I developed a new method that significantly enhances the accuracy of liver disease detection. This feature has been integrated into a virtual health assistant platform that can effectively identify patients who are at a higher risk of developing liver disease.
Developed Cancer Detection Model: I have successfully developed a powerful ML model that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately detect cancer cells in breast cancer imaging data. This cutting-edge technology has the potential to significantly improve the speed and accuracy of cancer diagnosis, which can help facilitate timely and effective treatment.
