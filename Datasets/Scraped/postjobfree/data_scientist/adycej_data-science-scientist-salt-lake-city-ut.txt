OVERVIEW

I learned the theories, skills and intricacies of Modelling/ML and Data Science along with the hands-on experience from the top minds at Fair Isaac, Experian, and Equifax in the financial services industry.

Advanced analytics needs to go from the "Basement/Research" to the "Living Room" of an organisation and must be impactful and executable-in order to drive bottom-line results. However, “I believe that people and People Skills are still the core of any business”.
