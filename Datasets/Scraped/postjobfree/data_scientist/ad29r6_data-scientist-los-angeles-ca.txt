WORK EXPERIENCE
USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center – Los Angeles, CA Data Scientist Intern May 2022 – August 2022 Explore the relationship between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and SBP:
• Targeted 5K+ patient data to conduct feature selection through a forward search method to filter meaningful features related to cancer prevention and cancer care.
• Compared the effectiveness for extending life with two medicines through survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier), summarized the key finding that BMI has a positive relationship with the lethality rate.
• Utilized the KM curve to evaluate the survival probability based on different stages, leveraged the logistic regression model to analyze and validate the relationship between NLR and SBP Research Factors Associated with Breast Cancer:
• Conducted research on 4024 breast cancer cases, applying six ML models (Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting) to predict patient outcomes.
• Evaluated random oversampling and SMOTE techniques for handling imbalanced data, with SMOTE demonstrating a 10% increase in accuracy.
• Identified Gradient Boosting as the top-performing model with 90% accuracy.
• Utilized cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring balanced recall and precision through precision-recall curves for improved model assessment. ACADEMIC PROJECTS
The Purchase and Redemption Forecasts-Challenge the Baseline – Los Angeles, CA January 2022 – June 2022
• Aggregated and processed 100k+ users' historical purchase and redemption data from 4 data sources into a MySQL database
• Led a team of 3 to build forecasting models to predict future cash flows based on users' historical purchase and redemption data to help Ant Financial Services Group (AFSG) improve its funds management abilities
• Leveraged Python to conduct data validation, processing, transformation, and integration in pipeline to reduce the model execution time by 4 mins/epoch.
• Developed 10+ systematic forecasting univariate & multivariate models for predictive analysis based on the weighted average of purchase and redemption error (Best model: LSTM) UI Change Implementation for Product Recommendation – Los Angeles, CA January 2022 – June 2022
