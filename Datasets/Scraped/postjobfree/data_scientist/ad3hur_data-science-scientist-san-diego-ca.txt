Bachelor of Computer Science
GITAM Deemed University Under UGC – India (GPA: 3.0) Certified courses in Database Management systems and Advanced Databases, Data Mining, Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. SKILLS
• Languages: Proficient in C, C++, Python, Fortran, R language, Databricks
• Applications: Developed data algorithms in C++, automation and visualization in Python, simulations in Fortran, and web apps in Java.
• Systems & Tools: Experienced in Linux, OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, and database management
(SQL, MySQL, NoSQL).
• Parallel & GPU Programming: Proficient with shared memory (OpenMP, Pthreads) and GPU (CUDA) development.
• Distributed Computing: Skilled in MPI for parallel computing environments. PROJECTS
• Shooting Methods: Implemented shooting methods in a range of examples such as, the pendulum, heat distribution in a rod, and rocket trajectory problems, using applied three different numerical methods, such as the second and fourth-order Runge-Kutta, Euler, bisection method, secant method, and Newton's method, selecting the most suitable method for each specific problem.
• Linear Least Squares: A Fortran program implementation of linear least squares problem-solving, utilizing the Conjugate Gradient method, particularly effective for large, sparse systems.
• 1D-Wave Equation: Worked on stimulating the dynamic behaviour of a string with constant mass density ρ under tension T, focusing on its vertical deflection due to different initial displacements. Utilizing the classical wave equation, we numerically solve for the string’s motion using a cantered finite difference method and analyze the results for two distinct initial conditions.
• Matrix Multiplication in 1D and 2D: Compared matrix multiplication and storage methods, testing eight different methodologies. Analyzed speed and efficiency using MPI and OpenMP to determine optimal techniques.
