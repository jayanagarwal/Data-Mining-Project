Research Assistant, Clark Labs, Worcester, MA May 2023 - Present
Foundation Models for Satellite Imagery, a collaboration between IBM and NASA aimed at leveraging AI technology to analyze NASA's Earth and geospatial science data, with a focus on geospatial intelligence and climate change research.
Implement image classi cation, segmentation, gap lling, and similarity search for multi-spectral satellite imagery.
Utilize GitHub for e ective collaboration and version control, and leverag AWS (Amazon Web Services) for e cient cloud computing and data storage.
Data Scientist, NON-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Tehran, Iran - Part time Jan 2018 - Apr 2020
Cleaned and wrangled messy healthcare data sets to produce insights by aggregating data from multiple sources, imputing missing values using predictive models, and performing Feature Engineering and Feature selection.
Applied advanced machine learning techniques on health insurance historical data for Anomaly Detection in Medical Claims.
Designed an Unsupervised Hybrid Model for Methylphenidate abuse detection in two levels of prescription and patient. The model increased the speed of monitoring and e ciency of identifying suspicious patients.
Performed Social Network Analysis (SNA) to reveal medication Co-prescription trends, Physician-patient relationships, and prescribing patterns.
Prepared reports using Data Visualization in R, Gephi, and Tableau, and presented the result in a technical and non-technical
(executive) format.
Selected Projects (Projects are available in my GitHub and Portfolio.)
Improving Urban Sustainability through Solar Panel Identi cation on Building Rooftops. PRME Award Winner in 6th Clark University Annual Student Business Analytics Competition. Extracted satellite tiles using QGIS and performed image processing using Pytorch in Google Colabs.
