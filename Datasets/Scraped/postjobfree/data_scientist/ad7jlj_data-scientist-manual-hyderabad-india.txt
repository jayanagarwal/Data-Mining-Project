Design And Development Of 5G Physical
Layer
121 Days
In order to be able to analyse how 5G will be
developed and how will it affect us in a socio-
economic manner, we have to take a close
look at the standardization bodies and
regulatory organisms involved in the
deployment of 5G. The fifth generation of
mobile communications systems (5G), is born
by the need of providing the consumer with a
more efficient, low-latency, reliable and less
battery consuming way of staying always
connected..
