CYBERSECURITY PROJECTS & LABS
Cybersecurity Incident Report: Network traffic analysis (Google)
● Given a sample DNS and ICMP traffic log through online lab resources, I was tasked with analyzing the network traffic, and logging my findings in an incident report document.
Complete Controls Assessment Document (Google)
● Evaluated the administrative, physical, and technical security controls in a system to determine if they are being implemented in the correct manner, and how high of a priority that specific control warrants based on the list of assets given.
Evaluate Suspicious Email & Create Alert Ticket (Google)
● Carefully examined the body and header of a malicious email and noted multiple discrepancies within the information provided. From that point I was tasked with creating an alert ticket to escalate the email for proper investigation and quarantine
Update File Permissions In Linux (Google)
● Given access to a sample company’s internal file directly, I accurately assessed the current state of the permission setting for the project file. After doing so, I examined the requested changes made by the company and implemented those changes to meet their needs.
