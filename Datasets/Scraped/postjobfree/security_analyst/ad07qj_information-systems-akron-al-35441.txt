Currently serving as a contract Senior Security Analyst Supporting the Veterans Administration Consolidated Mail Out Pharmacy. Worked with six pharmaceutical production (Prescription fulfillment and mail out) sites/facilities to ensure Authority to Operate security measures were in place, active, in practice, and documented in the VA Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS). Worked with facility level Information System Owners and System Stewards to analyze, document and support security practices and measures of the facilities in order to maintain the “Authority To Operate” as awarded on an annual basis post security profile review.

Supported VA customers in managing complex system records in the Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS) cloud based system, preparing each eMASS organizational instance for system Authority to Operate (ATO) processes and created (or gathered and added to the existing repository) Artifacts, control implementation details, and Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms).

Worked on a daily basis with the eMASS systems Risk Management Framework (RMF), and security compliance processes including Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) artifacts and documented processes. Familiarized myself with the Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) criteria and applied that knowledge in support of organizational Security measures and profiles. Supported each site through Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM), RMF automation, and Comply to Connect Memorandums of Understanding and Interconnect Systems Agreements MOU/ISA documentation.

Was trained on the Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) security documentation tools and methods on an annual basis and through monthy workshops and training seminars.

Regularly facilitated meetings. Reviewed and analysed authorization documents and associated Artifacts against authorization requirements to identify gaps, establish a schedule to address outstanding authorization requirements, and coordinated directly with system team stakeholders to complete security control and implementation of control standards are required by the VA 6500 compliant Standard Operating Procedures.

As a part of a monthly and quarterly tasking, generated security scan reports and prepared Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) based on any security issues that were detected in those scans. Also reviewed and prepared Plans of Action and Milestones based on trends found in scans for Security Configuration and Compliance Data (that failed to meet the Security Technical Implementation Guides [STIGs] set forth by VA requirements.

Maintained the currency and compliance of each Security Control and its associated Assessment Procedure (APs) and Control Correlation Identifiers (CCIs) as required by National Standards and Technology (NIST) guideline SP800-53.
