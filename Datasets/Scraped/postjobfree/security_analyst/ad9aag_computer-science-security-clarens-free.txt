Dear Hiring Committee,
I am writing to express my interest in the internship opportunity within your esteemed organization. With a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics, a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) specializing in Computer Applications Technology (CAT) and Mathematics, and currently pursuing an Honours degree in Computer Science at the University of Zululand, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively and bring valuable skills to your team.
My experience as an Assistant Teacher at Ndesheni High School allowed me to support learners in mathematics and assist teachers with various tasks, enhancing my skills in classroom management and curriculum development. In my current role as an IT Security Analyst at Bell Equipment, I handle role changes reports, check parameter settings in SAP, and create AS400 profiles, which has provided me with practical experience in technology application and security.
Happiness is a hardworking, spirited, innovative, responsible, and respectful individual who treats everyone with respect and dignity. I take a keen interest in whatever I do and am driven by a passion to succeed. I can execute any task with minimal supervision, communicate easily with others, embrace diversity, and adapt within teams. I am a good listener, a realist who motivates and supports others, and I accept both praise and criticism equally. My persuasive leadership ability is balanced by my ease in following leadership. The internship programme presents an ideal platform for me to develop my skills further and gain practical experience in a professional setting. I am drawn to the commitment to development and diversity, aligning with my values and aspirations. I meet all requirements, including being a South African citizen, having a Matric/Grade 12 certificate, and holding a tertiary qualification. I am prepared to enter into a learning agreement for 12 months. Enclosed is my resume, providing more details about my education, work experience, and skills.
