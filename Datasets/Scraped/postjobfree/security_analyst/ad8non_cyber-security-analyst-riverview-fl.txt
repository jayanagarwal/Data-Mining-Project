US VETERAN CYBER SECURITY SYSTEM ENGINEER
Scott C. Miller is a seasoned IT professional with a passion for CyberSecurity and a certification as a CISSP with over three decades of experience as a system administrator. Scott possesses extensive expertise in UNIX systems, which significantly contributes to his proficiency in the field. His tenure at GDC4S not only refined his skills but also earned him the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) designation, underscoring his dedication to excellence in CyberSecurity.

Scott is renowned for his exceptional verbal and written communication skills, enabling him to convey complex technical concepts with clarity and precision. In any professional setting, he is an invaluable asset due to his ability to rapidly identify deficiencies, assess needs, and implement practical, real-world solutions.

Professional Highlights
● Identifying Gaps: When joining a new organization, I quickly assessed the existing IT infrastructure to identify any deficiencies or areas for improvement. For example, the existing CyberSecurity measures must be adequate and meet the businesses needs.
● Determining Needs and Solutions: After identifying the gaps, I determined what was needed to address these issues. This could involve recommending new security tools or additional training for staff. I then provided practical solutions that could be implemented to meet those needs.
● Budget Management: In situations where the budget was insufficient for the required improvements, I explored ways to either reallocate existing funds, find cost-effective solutions, or advocate for additional resources. For instance, I might negotiate with vendors for better pricing or adjust project scopes to fit within the budget constraints. PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION CISSP Apr 2022
