Duties: The IAC investigates FBI employees, FBI contractors, and FBI Task Force Officers (TFO) to determine if these subjects can maintain a Top-Secret clearance. The FBI employees, FBI contractors, and TFOs have committed or are alleged to have committed a criminal or civil, or administrative offense that puts their Top-Secret clearance in jeopardy. The IAC conducts a civil investigation to determine if the FBI employee, FBI contractor, or TFO should maintain a Top-Secret or revoke their Top-Secret clearance. The IAC conducts investigative database research using the FBI and other law enforcement databases. The IAC arranges interviews of the subject, witnesses, and the subject’s supervisors. The IAC conducts interviews of witnesses, subjects, and relevant people to the investigation. The interviews are done with another IAC to confirm the interviewee’s testimony. The IAC writes a report of the interview and enters it in the electronic case file. The IAC uses the national security guidelines to determine if the subject has violated any national security guidelines. The IAC will determine if the investigation has answered the national security guidelines. When the IAC has completed the investigation, the case results are sent to FBI management, and they make the final decision on the suitability of the subject to maintain their Top-Secret clearance. The IAC must know the national security guidelines and constantly review national security policies and procedure changes. The FBI security division has bi-weekly meetings to update the FBI employees and contractors on FBI policies and procedures changes. The IAC conducts civil and administrative investigations for the FBI. The FBI promoted me from the Personnel Security Specialist position to the IAC. When I was promoted to my current position, I stayed in the FBI Security Division and on the same contract. I was transferred from PAE to PSI. I received NCIC and FINCEN training since I was an IAC.
