• Provide a single plane of glass view to the central bank about the security posture of the member banks, accomplished gap analysis with each member bank and prepared a document about current security posture and risks.
• Mapped the member bank siem alerts to a central MITRE framework dashboard, the environment is one master and 23 collectors, also integrated Arctic security alerts and inquest ips alerts to siem, wrote custom integrator script for Arctic security. Implementation done in multiple data centers.
• For a large manufacturing company, Monitored and deployed Netsurion XDR platform on a AWS hosted environment, the SIEM server will collect telemetry from cloud data sources like cloud trail, IAM, Guard duty, Kemp load balancer.
• For a large Network solutions company, Monitored and Deployed Netsurion XDR platform in a master and collector model, the partner is having huge number of FortiGate firewalls deployed across different retail locations.
• Logs are being aggregated to a Forti analyzer, we configured the Forti analyzer to send the logs over tls to a collector, parsed the device names with a regex and mapped to system manager on the master.
• Configured FortiGate related monitoring alerts for auth failures, virus alerts, configuration changes, prepared hand over documents for soc operations to monitor daily and worked along with partner to handle any technical questions.
• For a large healthcare services company, planned the initial architecture and sizing of the hardware based on the log sources inventory.
• Deployed SIEM on to their Azure and AWS environments, each environment will have its own collector and both collectors report to a master hosted in AWS cloud.
• Multiple log sources covered like windows, Linux. Mac os, Azure Ad, Cisco AMP, Zscaler, Okta, IAM, rewrote the integrator scripts to work in pulling the logs from cisco amp, okta etc... TECHNICAL SKILLS
