• If you are reading this and wondering “why was the duration of his employment with Parker Wellbore only 5 months?”, I would be happy to go into why we parted ways, if interested. It was strictly mutual, and I left on such good terms that my manager and a coworker of the cybersecurity team are both listed as references and will speak on my performance as an IT Security Analyst.
