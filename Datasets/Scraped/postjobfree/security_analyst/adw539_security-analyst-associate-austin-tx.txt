EDUCATION
LamarUniversity:3yearsstudy
Dual major in Biology and Chemistry. Junior year completed Sr Product Security Analyst with Synack
Feb 2022 - Present
This is a senior role to the Product Security Analyst role that included more external speaking engagements, additional responsibilities regarding financial impact analysis, risk analysis, advising sales and marketing on matters, and interacting more closely with Executive staff/board both internally and with our clients. I function as a trouble shooter when we are stuck and help sales and technical teams find ways to address client needs while meeting business needs. I also lead the Synack Missions Catalog and product, working on new additions to meet client needs while falling within technical capabilities that we have. External vendor relationships and channel partners also are things I deal with on a normal basis. Compared to the prior position, I have much more input into the business operations of both ourselves and our clients. In this position I have also briefed the entirety of our client facing employees to explain headless API testing as a product to technical and non-technical teams. I also was key in developing our human led API testing program for clients and insuring itâ€™s financial success.

PROFILE
Soft Skills: I love a challenge - I dared myself to learn German in 12 months and passed a test with near native fluency. Public speaking is actually fun for me and a noted skill. I am known among my peers for being able to explain complex ideas and technologies to non-technical teams. I am a people person who interacts well with others. I am highly self motivated and love a challenge. Writing reports, working in and leading a team are all second nature. Finding novel solutions to a problem while also keeping regulations, business needs and best practices in mind is a core competency.
I have presented as a moderator for panel discussions and as a main speaker on many security topics. This includes being invited to speak at BSides Ahmedabad, and also on the floor at RSA 2022, Black Hat 2022, and many virtual presentations. This is in addition to writing several articles and blogs on security at scale.
I work well with all levels of executives and management and have done so with management and executives from Global 50 companies and large government agencies. Cross team coordination and managing groups is a skill I have background and training in also.
