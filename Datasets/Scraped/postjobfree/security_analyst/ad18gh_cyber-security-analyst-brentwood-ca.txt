June, 2015 – Until April-2023 Visa Inc, Highlands Ranch- CO Recently working in IAM organization as Sr. Cybersecurity Analyst in Privileged Access Management team and during this tenure below are my accomplishments.
• Gathering data for DB2 UDB and Oracle RDBMS platforms in Unix OS environments for DB admin level privileged access across Visa organization and analyzed for privilege access security GAPS and accordingly closed all gaps. Accordingly, TSR policies to respective areas were also updated to avoid further prevention.
• In IAM RBAC (Role Base Access Control) area worked with end user external teams to understand their problem areas and to make access process more friendly, worked with IAM dev, QA and platform team to avail new UI based “Enterprise Role Studio” single point web based tool which end user can use for all RBAC access related activities. This involved gathering requirements from customer and incorporate all solutions in the tool. This was a major success across visa for all end users to avail UNIX base access through “Enterprise Role Studio”.
• To close security gaps within RBAC new access policies were designed on approvals and incorporated in “Enterprise Role Studio”. With fine grained approval process access to critical admin accounts was brought under control.
• Worked as TPM on Visa SUDO migration for all UNIX platform servers involving +70K servers. For privileged access. Visa had third party tool called UPM and overall fees paid for this tool was saved by migrating all UNIX platform servers under Visa internally developed Visa SUDO. Project duration spanned across approx. 2 years and during this same period managed to collaborate with application owners to provide insight/training on newly developed product and their benefits to user as well as Visa. Collaborated with IAM internal teams and worked as TPM alongside the internal as well as external team to ensure smooth migration process.
• Currently working on admin and service accounts for Unix, Windows, MVS and Tandem platform and their enrollment into ERPM tool (Enterprise Random Password 2
