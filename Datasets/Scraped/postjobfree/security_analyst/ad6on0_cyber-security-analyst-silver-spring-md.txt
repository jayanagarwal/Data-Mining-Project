SOC Analyst
● I was mainly responsible for collecting raw data as well as reviewing alarms and alerts.
● I confirmed, determined or adjusted the criticality of alerts and enrich them with relevant data.
● Did triage to identify whether alerts were justified or a false positive,
● An additional responsibility I had at this level is identifying other high-risk events and potential incidents.
● I did alerts prioritized according to their criticality. If problems occurring cannot be solved at this level, I made sure to escalate them to tier 2 analysts.
● I Collaborated in team problem-solving efforts to identify and mitigate potential threats or events.
● I did Partnered with Security Engineers to understand and improve monitoring, logging, and alert prioritization to enhance SOC investigation and response.
● I monitored SIEM logs (Splunk) for undetected events, equally created tickets for malicious logs, reporting information security concerns and problems, when necessary.
● I monitored security events correlating information from data center feeds and functional areas to identify incidents, issues, threats, and vulnerabilities.
● Analyzed network traffic files (PCAP) differentiating between potential intrusion attempts and false alarms and acting on these logs as needed.
● Assist in the creation and update of SOPs, information security policies, and other technical documentation.
● Investigated a variety of phishing email and make determination on whether they are malicious or not with email protection tools (PhishER/ProofPoint).
● Perform research on new threats happening and vulnerabilities using security blogs and news outlets and checking my environment using security tools.
● Analyzing EDR (Digital guardian, Crowdstrike ) logs to determine severity of logs and provided appropriate remediation.
● Investigate malicious IPs, Domains, and URLs using Open-Source tools and escalate to the network team for blocking using ticketing tool (SNow).
● Utilize vulnerability scanner (Qualys) to analyze discovery scan data and vulnerability data to determine unusual use configurations, discovery of aged software, and proper identification of high-severity vulnerabilities.
● Escalate potential security incidents to clients recommending further actions and operational improvements. CableNET Inc. Maryland
