Profile
I am a creative, motivated, and hardworking individual with a wide range of expertise and experience. Having been personally affected by cyber-attacks in the past, I empathize with the victims and understand how devastating online threats can be. This led to a passion for helping others by preventing these scams. I am team-oriented, eager to learn, and excited to adapt to the always changing challenges that come with this field of work. My experiences abroad have heightened both my attention to detail and situational awareness in reference to both scams and threats online and in person, making me an asset that any cyber security organization can benefit from.
