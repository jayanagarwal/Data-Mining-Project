EXPERIENCE

SECURITY ANALYST: A MEMBER OF THE SECOPS & INFRA TEAM
Texas southern university (OIT) 2022 - Active
•Spearheaded the implementation of advanced threat detection tools, such as Microsoft Entra ID Threat Intelligence, leading to the identification of over 50 suspicious activities in system logs within the first quarter.
•Established a security log analysis routine that reviewed over 500 logs weekly, identifying five previously undetected patterns of suspicious activities which enhanced overall vigilance against potential threats.
•Developed and enforced comprehensive compliance protocols for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), resulting in 98% user
adoption and a substantial decrease in unauthorized access incidents, reinforcing overall data security.
•Championed the implementation of automated response mechanisms that facilitated immediate isolation of infected endpoints, contributing to a significant reduction in the time taken to remediate security incidents by 65%.
•Executed comprehensive risk analysis using device trajectory data to identify infection causes and timelines, isolated and remediated over 150 malicious files, restoring compromised endpoints to a secure state within 24 hours.
•Pioneered and deployed monitoring strategies using EDR and XDR tools, resulting in the identification of over 150 malicious files, improved incident response capabilities, leading to a compromise rate reduction from 30% to 0.1%.
•Collaborated with the infrastructure team to deploy critical security patches and applications, ensuring compliance across 900 endpoints, efforts led to a marked improvement in the security stance and minimized vulnerabilities.
Established Geo-blocking policies that mitigated external threats and suspicious networks by leveraging Palo Alto firewalls, this approach
improved security posture and reduced the number of attempted breaches by 85%.
