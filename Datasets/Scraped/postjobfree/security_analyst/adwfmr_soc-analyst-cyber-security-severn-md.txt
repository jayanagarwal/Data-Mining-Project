Experience
Mount Saint Mary’s University
SOC Analyst January 2022-Present
Monitor live security events, identify possible breaches, review network logs, triage e-mails that have been tagged as phishing, disseminate information as it becomes available to coordinate relevant teams.
Daily Threat Hunting
oUsing logs from various sources (Azure AD sign-ins, email phishing activity, canvas sign-ins) from Elasticsearch Kibana interface to proactively watch the environments to detect and block any suspicious activity or discrepancies.
Investigate potential compromised accounts.
oA detailed search and analysis are conducted on any suspected compromised account to determine validity and if the account is compromised, it’s escalated to networking team for remediation.
Build out production rules to alert on anomalies, spikes, or other patterns of interest from data in Elasticsearch.
oSearch Microsoft teams group distro for alerts requiring investigation, check if alerts are working as designed, rule out false positives and validate real alerts for possible investigation.
Deploy Elasticsearch Honeypot in test environment to examine Attacker TTP(tactics, techniques, procedures)
o This step is undertaken to determine suspicious IP addresses that are added to a blocklist and escalated to network team to update to production environment.
Research current threats and vulnerabilities
oResearch to determine new threats and vulnerabilities based on published articles from security researchers, top technology companies to determine impact on environments and explore proposed technologies and remediations for preventing attacks.
