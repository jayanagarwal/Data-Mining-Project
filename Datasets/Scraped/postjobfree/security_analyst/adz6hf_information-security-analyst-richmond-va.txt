Projects
1. File Integrity Monitoring Project: Conceptualized and developed a custom File Integrity Monitor (FIM) using Python, enhancing system integrity by monitoring, and reporting unauthorized changes. This proactive measure helped in minimizing potential data breaches, bolstering system stability, and upholding the principles of the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). This project enhanced my knowledge and practice of data integrity and security measures, incident response, and software development.
2. Vulnerability Management Project: Led the charge to upgrade the organization's vulnerability management processes, which included implementing Nessus Essentials for conducting regular vulnerability scans. This implementation helped identify over 300 potential threats in the initial month, which were then systematically addressed, thereby substantially improving the overall security posture of the organization. My role allowed me to deepen my understanding of vulnerability management, risk assessment, and cybersecurity remediation efforts.
3. SIEM Tools in Azure Project: Orchestrated the deployment of Azure Sentinel, a cloud native SIEM tool, to improve data security, visibility, and response time. This project involved creating custom log sources, fine-tuning alerts, and developing playbooks for automated incident response, which reduced mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) by over 30%. My contribution to this project honed my skills in cloud security, log analysis, and automated response procedures.
