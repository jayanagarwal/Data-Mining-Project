My overall goal is to become an information security analyst. After obtaining the CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst and AWS Security Specialty certifications, I will solidify the technical skills needed to pinpoint and interpret statistically significant patterns related to cyber threats. I plan to increase my knowledge and ability to configure and monitor intrusion detection systems, and to read, interpret, and analyze network traffic and related log files by obtaining GCIA and ultimately the CISSP certification after being in the industry for five years.
Highly motivated and dedicated cybersecurity professional, leveraging pursuant AA degree in information security, supplemental certifications, and internship experience safeguarding enterprise networks and assets. seeking an opportunity that provides growth and development of analytical skills responding to breaches and viruses: helping to implement, monitor, and upgrade security measures to protect networks and sensitive information.
