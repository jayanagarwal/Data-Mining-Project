To Whom It May Concern,
Re: Debra Gould.
I am writing this letter to recommend Debra Gould for a sales position with your firm. She is only available for new positions due to a corporate decision to close the U.S. office and consolidate operations of Online Electronics Ltd in the Aberdeen office in the U.K. This action followed earlier actions to consolidate the Asian operations back to Aberdeen as well. Her departure is not due to lack of ability, commitment, or ambition on her part. In our time together I found her personality to be very much an engaging and interested salesperson with natural skills in bonding with clients. She understands how to use common programs on the computer and is adept at data mining social media. She has a technical degree which aided her understanding of our industry and company offering. Our products are based in electronics and physics, and she picked up their utilization and technical requirements quickly as well as applications of product in the pipe. She certainly is not afraid of hard work or slugging it out in the trenches.
She wants to excel at her work and has the necessary ambition to advance her career. While our time together was limited, I believe she would have gone on and done very well with our company.
I wholeheartedly recommend her to your company as she will be a dedicated salesperson with a willingness to learn and grow.
Sincerely,
Scott Lewis
Regional Manager Americas
