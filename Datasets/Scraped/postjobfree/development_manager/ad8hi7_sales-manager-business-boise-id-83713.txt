I am the only guy from Idaho to win a national Golden Gloves title and be chosen fighter of the year and tournament. This is a great honor called the "GoldenBoy" Award. I would train hard while dieting so I could come in on weight and win. I won three world titles as a professional fighter and was televised three times on T.V. I really loved my professional career but, being the captain of U.S. boxing team was the best. The U.S. boxing team chose who the captain was, being picked by my U.S. team to be captain was a great honor. The trust they had in me to have them do what I believed they needed to do to win was amazing. Myself, never losing any international fight on the U.S. boxing team speaks volumes of leadership. This is Russia and Korea included.
