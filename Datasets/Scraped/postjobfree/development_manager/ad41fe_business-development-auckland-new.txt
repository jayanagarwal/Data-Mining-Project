I successfully managed the development and execution of strategic initiatives to grow market share and maximize profitability, while also playing a key role in establishing a new business entity in Malaysia. I bring to the table a strong skill set in strategic planning, relationship building, sales and negotiation, and financial analysis. My Bachelor of Computer Science degree from the University of Auckland provides me with a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to contribute to the growth of Concord Legend in New Zealand, leveraging my cross-cultural experience and passion for driving results. I am impressed by Concord Legend's commitment to providing excellent remuneration and support to its employees, and I am eager to contribute to the continued success of the company.
