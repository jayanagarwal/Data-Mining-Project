Dear Hiring Manager,
I am a results-driven professional with a long history in achieving quota metrics, looking to relocate back to my home state of Mississippi. I possess a B.S.B.A degree in Merchandising along with a certificate in Professional Selling from The University of Southern Mississippi of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. I feel I am uniquely qualified because of my work experience in medical aesthetics in outside sales, allowing me multiple opportunities that parallel the responsibilities of this position. I am looking for a role that allows me to apply my ambition and drive to achieve the highest amount of revenue for this company. Being able to apply my outside sales skills and current relationships within the industry will allow me to hit the ground running in this territory. As my resume indicates, I have several years of experience in the sales industry in which I have assisted clients
(B2B and B2C) with organized partnerships and the duties and responsibilities associated with relationship building and upselling. I have performed many different roles in my sales career, leading to my extensive knowledge and expertise in medical aesthetics, business development, and sales. I have recent work experience in medical skincare sales as an Account Development Manager which has seasoned me for this position. I am a hunter in the field and I truly love developing new partnerships with aesthetic practices. With having a long history in business development, I really focus on this when prospecting new accounts - My main goal is to help develop and drive business within these practices, utilizing my products to achieve a constant stream of revenue and return patients. As much as I love offering helpful products to consumers, my main goal is to benefit overall practice success to my clients and future partnerships through the products I am selling.
During my most recent role as a B2B Account Development Manager with Jan Marini Skin Research, I was responsible for many different tasks, including prospecting, harvesting, and maintaining new accounts, along with developing customer relationships for future success.I have also developed numerous relationships with networking partners such as other skincare, injectable, and aesthetic device reps. It is because of these opportunities and skills I feel I would make an excellent candidate and part of your team. I would love for you to review my resume and explore how my skills and experience could best meet your team’s needs. Thank you for the opportunity to apply for this role. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Best Regards,
