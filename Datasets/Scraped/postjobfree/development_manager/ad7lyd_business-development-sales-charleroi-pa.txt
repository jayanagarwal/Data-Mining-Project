Brief Job History:
Over 40 years Sales & Marketing, B-B Business Consulting, Business Development in multiple fields.
I have had varied managerial positions from GSM, Local Manager, National Sales Manager, Senior National Marketing Director – and now I’m self employed with my own consulting and business development company.
To be perfectly frank, I’m a little older than your normal applicant, going to be 81 in December 21, 2024 – yet in perfect health, still functioning well mentally and do a lot around the household since my wife has MS and for the past 16 years have worked remotely from my home office, and still doing work. DOB: 12/21/1943
So I’m only interested in remote position but can do some local driving which I still have valid approved drivers license.

Please let me know if you have the unusual fit for someone my age. I would be glad to make a personal visit to your office to meet face to face.
Thank you so much for the opportunity - Perry
