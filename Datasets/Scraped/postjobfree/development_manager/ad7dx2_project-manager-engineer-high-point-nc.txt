David Charles Smith _ Design Engineering, Production & Marketing Project Management INTRODUCTION: My background begins with craft shows. Teaching myself how to take an idea and put it on paper. Then, how to optimize the raw material and fabricate it into the desired piece. With no marketing experience, it took time to develop that ability, but it served me well later. When the craft show boom of the 90’s faded, I became a builder in local industry. I then expanded into Kitchen Design (project manager) and later given the opportunity to learn several design software platforms.
I now have an extensive background in design, illustration, processing, fabrication, marketing and management.
I want to share my knowledge & experience with a company devoted to high quality output. Having the pride and integrity required for successful growth.
