CITY, ST

Dear [Employer's Name],

With a proven track record of driving operational efficiency and fostering professional growth across teams for more than 23 years, I am well-qualified for your advertised position for [job title]. Your requirements align well with my leadership experience. I have a deep understanding of business operations, employee management, complex problem solving, and analytical thinking. I am confident that I would be a valuable addition to your executive leadership team.

As Supportability Manager at Intuit, I developed and unleashed the power of new strategies such as pioneering AI-driven support options and utilizing data to set KPIs and performance expectations. In addition, I was able to achieve a 98% customer satisfaction rate while reducing response times by 35%. I have led multiple teams of in-person and remote professionals.

I have improved employee morale with clear communication skills to present sales and customer service analysis as well as implementing strategies to deliver corporate goals. I have conceived and led special projects including one at Intuit where I built a team to work with five small local businesses using Quickbooks to identify pain points and propose strategies to improve the customer experience. Along traditional outreach activities to the community, I helped Intuit improve corporate impact on the Tucson area.

I am eager to bring my innovative spirit and transformative leadership to the esteemed team at [Company Name]. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Didier Banhie
