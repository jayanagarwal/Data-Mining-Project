Resume Brief
Experience in Quality Oversite, Performance Improvement and Cause Analysis

During the last ten years of my career the implementation of the Quality Assurance corrective action program has been at the engineer, auditor, mentor, instructor, and management level positions. My experience in quality engineering has also covered all phases of the product development cycles from design, procurement, manufacturing, installation, and commissioning. Working in the twenty companies as an employee and consultant I have noted that managementâ€™s approach to quality is fundamental for ensuring success of the organization and I performed my part to ensure quality whether as a supervisor, an individual contributor, or a team member.

Maintenance Engineering (1973 â€“ 1976): USS Enterprise Machinery Division Officer (Steam Plant): Causal Factors identified in equipment repairs were due to expected wear. Equipment failures were due to human error, environmental events, fabrication induced flaws, and procurement errors.

Maintenance Engineer General Electric Nuclear Division (1976-1979): Causal Factors of Piping failures due to metallurgical technology was ineffective in identifying initial flaws in piping welds and lack of understanding of thermal cycling & chemical stresses which induced corrosion mechanisms.

System Safety Engineer Lockheed Trident Missile Systems (1979- 1981): Performed failure mode and effects analysis (ordnance firing systems), fault tree analysis (battery failures, printed circuit boards), change analysis (battery assembly) and barrier analysis (engineering specifications}.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission Resident Inspector and Engineering Project Manager (1981 â€“ 1989): Performed event investigations and oversight of electric utility plant events caused by human performance errors, management weaknesses and engineering design errors.

Nuclear Quality Engineer (Clinton Nuclear Plant, 1998): Performed apparent and root cause analysis of human performance errors and equipment failures for the Nuclear Engineering Department.

Maintenance Engineer (Limerick Nuclear Plant, 2007 - 2008): Performed Apparent Cause Evaluations of Maintenance and Construction incidents. Causal Factors were human performance and human-machine interface problems for implementing recent technology for the first time. Data entry using TAP ROOT handbook for trending. Mentored first line supervisors on Cause Analysis investigations.

Corrective Action Program Evaluator (2010): Assessed completed Apparent and Root Cause Evaluations. Developed Corrective Actions for inadequate Evaluations and inadequate Extent of Conditions with responsible supervisors.

Construction Quality Supervisor (2011-2012): Verified Quality and Design Testing Requirements from Procurement Phase to Installation Phase for foundation geological mapping and concrete placements were met. Verified engineering analysis and corrective actions for non-conformances were completed.

Quality Manager Lessons Learned Manager (2013-2014). Developed two-day Root and Apparent Cause Training Course. Developed Lessons Learned Workshops for Construction and Manufacturing problems. Developed procedures for identifying causal factors for Corrective Action Reports data. Provided Training on the Courses, Workshops and Department Procedures. Performed apparent and root causes as a team member investigating Manufacturing Process errors.

Quality Engineer, Manufacturing Process Improvement (2015-2016). Performed causal analysis and developed and completed corrective actions to improve steel fabrication processes involving human errors and procedural deficiencies. Corrective Actions primarily involved coordination with Project Engineers, First Line Supervisors, Quality Control Inspectors, Welding Engineers, and Division Managers (DOE, DOD, Commercial). Wrote the Divisionâ€™s Corrective Action Program Procedure and mentored Corrective Action Coordinators.
