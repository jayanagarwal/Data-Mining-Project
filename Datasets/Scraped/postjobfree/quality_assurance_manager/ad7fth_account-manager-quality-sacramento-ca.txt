I bring over **+ years of team experience to any organization or position. My experience is almost exclusively in fast-paced communication environments. As an Account Manager I was responsible for a book of SMB clients and their growth. I have experience working with a variety of other teams daily across multiple channels of communication. I also have extensive experience with piloting new lines of business and verticals. This involves creating standard operating procedures, metrics and quality assurance protocols for the new departments, as well as training new agents to fill the department. This is all followed up then by regular calibration meetings to ensure leadership across multiple teams are all on the same page. Thank you for your consideration!
