To Whom It May Concern:
This letter is my professional and personal recommendation for Jeremy Shinn. I have worked with Jeremy from March 2017 – January 2020. Jeremy was a Senior Field Superintendent for the Summit Sky Ranch Development located in Silverthorne. During this time, I was the Project Manager of Vertical Construction for the Development. As a Senior Superintendent Jeremy directly oversaw and supervised numerous construction activities including, all rough-in scopes of works, insulation, siding, roofing, drywall, framing verifications, flatwork, and exterior drainage plane. He worked directly with our third-party building consultants verify proper installation techniques. He also managed all monthly billings, change orders, schedule management and material procurements. Although Jeremy was not originally hired in a senior position, he quickly rose those the ranks to become an invaluable member of the core group of managers. He is well versed in the general construction industry, he has a good understanding of the means and methods of construction and has good relationships with building officials and subcontractors. Jeremy did very well with monitoring the projects for quality, budget control and safety with very high expectations. Besides being a joy to work with, Jeremy has excellent communication skills. In addition, he is extremely organized, reliable, and highly computer literate. Jeremy can work independently and is able to follow through to ensure that the job gets done. He is flexible and willing to work on any project that is assigned to him. Jeremy was one of my go to guys to assist in any role or area we needed help with during our tenure together.
With my 20+ years of construction management experience I can honestly say Jeremy would be a tremendous asset for your company and has my highest recommendation. If you have any further questions regarding his background or qualifications, please do not hesitate to call me. Sincerely,
Shawn Connelly, LEED AP

To whom it may concern,
I have had the pleasure of working with Mr. Jeremy Shinn for the last few years. He has always been great to work with, is very professional, honest and cares about his projects. He treats all people on his job sites with respect and is deeply knowledgeable about his projects. We have some of the best contractors/ project supervisors in the state working in Summit County and Mr. Shinn is among them. He makes my job easy, because when mistakes happen, he takes ownership and always makes the correction. That being said, he has proven himself to be a trustworthy manager. I hope to work with him in our County again. Feel free to contact me with questions. Don Bantam

To Whom it May Concern,
It is with great confidence I write to you to recommend Jeremy Shinn, who served as a project manager on my last two developments, Apres Shores (60 units multi family) and River West (92 units multi family). Jeremy joined the construction team we had hired midway through a huge project, and not only was an essential part of project completion, but he played a major roll in managing a mess he inherited from the previous PM. Jeremy is punctual, level headed, takes pride in his work, and is proactive in situations that are inevitably encountered in the construction industry. Jeremy is quick to learn, and will put in the extra effort it takes to fill his role on any project which enables him to adapt to the ever changing construction industry in Summit County, CO and beyond. As the developer of both projects, I admired Jeremy’s ability to fill whatever roll he was needed in while working for a General Contractor who ran a smaller operation, and thus asked Jeremy to wear many different hats in his time working on our projects. Jeremy has always been honest and straightforward when working for us, and has played an active roll in making sure the team was proactive rather than reactive in their management. Upon Jeremy beginning work with our company, both projects ran much smoother as a result of his involvement. On top of it all, Jeremy has an incredible work ethic and is always hungry to learn more and sharpen his craft.
