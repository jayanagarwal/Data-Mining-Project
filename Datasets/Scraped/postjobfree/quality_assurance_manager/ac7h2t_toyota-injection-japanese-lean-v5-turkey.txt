MURAT TERZİ September, ****

Summary
I am an experienced manager who worked in Automotive, Aerospace and FMCG
industries with different roles. Within my 21 years of experience, I took part in many
multinational projects consisting of teams from various countries.

Ever since I got promoted to Manager title in 2007, I have managed 50 people on
average in the companies I worked for. I interviewed and hired many staff including supervisors,
engineers, technicians and operators.

My background is mainly Quality and Lean Manufacturing as I was grown in Toyota spending almost 12 years of my career. TPM and Production Engineering Management were also some other fields I experienced. Moreover, Project and R&D Engineering were the areas I started up my career as a young engineer.

I have been certified and experienced in almost all of the QMS (ISO9001, ISO/TS 16949, AS9100) and other management systems (ISO14001 and ISO18000). I conducted several internal audits and was undergone many 3rd Party audits. I am strong at all IATF core tools (FMEA, SPC, MSA, APQP, PPAP) as well. I also used VDA 6.3 when I was working with customers like VW, AUDI and BMW.

Blue print reading, GD&T knowledge, fixture and gauging, injection moulding, vacuum moulding, sheet metal forming, welding, machining and high pressurized aluminum casting are the subjects that I experienced in detail throughout my career. In addition to that, NDT inspection, precise machining, Heat Treatment, Chemical treatment are the processes I have started to experience in Aerospace industry.

I have a good knowledge and practice on Lean Manufacturing concepts like JIT, Jidouka, Takt Time and Line Balancing, Kanban-Pull System, One-piece Flow, Poka-Yoke, Value Streamt Mapping, Kaizen, 5S e.g.

I am a good problem solver as I was taught A3 thinking in Toyota. Not only many problem solving projects succeeded in Toyota, but I also used several times 8D methodology to respond customers like PSA and Continental. I managed to complete one 6 Sigma Black Belt Project when I was working in FMCG industry.
