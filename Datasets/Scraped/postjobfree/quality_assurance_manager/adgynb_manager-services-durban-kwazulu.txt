Would you rather fight a skunk the size of a horse or 100 horses the sizes of skunks? And why? I would prefer to fight a skunk the size of a horse. Simply because one skunk equals one problem. I would have more control over the situation and the problem could can be divided into "bite-size" puzzle pieces and resolved individually to contribute to the overall desired result of solving the problem as a whole.
