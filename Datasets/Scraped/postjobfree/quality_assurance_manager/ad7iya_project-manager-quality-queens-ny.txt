SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE

I am a passionate and proactive Scrum Master and Agile Project Manager with over eight years of professional experience in the education domain. I am highly proficient in agile frameworks such as Scrum, Lean, Kanban, XP, SAFe, and Scrum at Scale. I have successfully adopted these frameworks in completing different projects, including the development and management of web-based result computation software and the optimization of academic quality assurance processes.

I exhibit emotional intelligence, kaizen, and resilience within and across teams and champion business agility through adaptive planning and early and continuous value delivery. I am highly proficient in facilitation, servant leadership, stakeholder and C-suite management, risk management, research, and coaching, with a passion for continuous learning. By introducing interrupt buffer and swarming techniques, I have helped my team accommodate changes better and faster, meeting stakeholders' expectations and earning positive feedback, which increased by 62% on average over four sprints. Swarming also accelerated delivery by 41% in four sprints.
