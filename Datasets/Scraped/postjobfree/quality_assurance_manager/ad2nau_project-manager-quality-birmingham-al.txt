Project Name— Mitigating Risk To Farmers &
Ranchers
The Chief Operations O cer had a vision to
mitigate security risk to ranchers. Injuries
related to heavy machinery had risen
throughout the year and upper management
wanted to reduce the threat of injury while not
becoming a detriment to productivity. An
inspection team was hired to gather details on
when workers most often applied for worker’s
compensation, and for what reason. After the
project planning meeting, and meeting with
upper management a 3rd party vendor around
safety was hired. The goal was to reduce
accidents by 25% by year-end.
