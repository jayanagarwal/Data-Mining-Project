Project: Super Over (Scratchy machine game)
Project Description: "Super Over" is a scratch card game that I developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

I implemented various features such as multiple levels of difficulty, a timer, and sound effects. The game also has a backend system developed using PHP and MySQL to manage the prizes and user information.
