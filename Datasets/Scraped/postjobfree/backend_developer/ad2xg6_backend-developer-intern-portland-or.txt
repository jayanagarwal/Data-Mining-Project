SOFTWAREDEVELOPMENT ENGINEERING July 2022 - September 2023
• As a key backend developer for the Repair/Requote team, led multiple contractors. Contributed in several geo-expansion efforts, notably for Apple products such as Repair/Requote and supportApp. Led backend development for the Repair/Requote team, leading to successful ex- pansion into Malaysia. Worked on some of the disclosed products for future releases at Apple.
• Developed addressValidation api that removed the redundancy of same api definition from 5 microservices. Reduced the time complexity for Apis like quote, addressValidation, and lookUp.
• Used Java, Springboot, Splunk, Protobuf, Mongodb, AWS, Couchbase Server, Integration testing, and React. Apple Hyderabad, India
SOFTWAREDEVELOPMENT ENGINEERING INTERN January 2022 - July 2022
• Interned as a backend developer for 6 months on supportApp, focusing on transitioning from REST-API to gRPC for the symptomWS microser- vice. Achieved a 1/3 reduction in data transfer rates using Protobuf. Leveraged gRPC and Protobuf to cut latency in half, minimize garbage collector time by 1/3, and enhance CPU efficiency by around 50 percent. Was one among top 5 percent performer.
• Used Java, gRPC, Protobuf, and Spring boot.
Cisco System (India) Private Limited Bangalore, India TECHNICAL UNDERGRADUATE INTERN May 2021 - July 2021
• During my 2-month internship as a frontend developer in the Datacenter team, employed React Three Fiber to create 3D visualizations for 2D graphs of nodes and VMs. The resulting 3D models not only enhanced animation but also introduced a real-time context based search feature for various nodes and VMs within the Cisco network. Made visualizing complex networks of nodes easier and interactive with features like node expansion on click and display of all its internal features.
• Used React Three Fiber, Blender, Linear Algebra, Dgraph, and React. Education

AI-INTEGRATED WEB APPLICATION :
• Developed an AI-integrated web application that utilizes two open APIs: OpenAI API and Spotify Open API.
• Made playlists using user’s prompt to get songs through chatgpt Open API and then queried the spotify and made a playlist based on number of songs required by user.
• Used Python, Django, MVP architecture, React, gcloud, AWS, OpenAI, Docker, and Spotify open API. IMAGE CAPTION GENERATOR :
• Implemented a Python project to develop a caption generator using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory.
• Extracted image features using Xception, a pre-trained CNN model on the ImageNet dataset. Integrated the extracted features into an LSTM model to generate descriptive captions for images. FARM PROXY :
• An integrated portal for farmers to detect disease and predict yield to sell/manage their produce/cultivation at a better rate.
• Real-time image of leaf to detect disease.Trained a CNN to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases.Themodelhadanaccuracyof99.35 percent.
• Crop yield prediction model was trained on a large dataset of historical crop and weather data, using deep learning techniques. It achieved an accuracy of 97 percent.
