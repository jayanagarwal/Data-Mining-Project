● As a Software Engineer, I held a key position in the development and optimization of Spring Boot applications vital to the seamless operation of the firm. Crafted scripts and utilities to automate tasks, and facilitate data comparison.
● I assumed responsibility for ensuring quality assurance by crafting thorough unit tests, automation tests leveraging tools such as Cucumber, conducting rigorous end-to-end testing, and implementing contract tests. Additionally, I employed SonarQube to conduct meticulous code coverage analysis. Experienced in utilizing databases including DB2, CRDB, and Oracle.
● Worked closely with DevOps teams and used CI/CD Jenkins pipelines for building, deploying, scanning, and creating snapshots/images for applications. Leveraged performance monitoring tools like Splunk and Dynatrace to continuously monitor applications, delivering vital performance metrics crucial for business operations. Utilized JMeter and BlazeMeter, robust tools for load testing and performance evaluation of Java applications. Participated in after-hours production support.
● Crafted Python scripts to seamlessly interact with CockroachDB databases via AWS EC2 servers, establish robust connections to various APIs, and harness the power of Python libraries to efficiently execute targeted operations.
● Employed Terraform to define cloud resources through easily understandable configuration files, and Kubernetes and its command-line interface (CLI) for aiding in the configuration, scaling, and monitoring the health of clusters and pods of apps.
● Utilized AWS services including EC2, S3, and Secrets Manager to securely store critical data, manage, retrieve, and rotate database credentials, application credentials, OAuth tokens, API keys, and other sensitive information throughout their life cycles, fulfilling various operational needs. Utilized Apache Kafka for messaging and event streaming in Java applications.
● Actively participated in Agile development methodologies, including daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning, product backlog refinements (PBR) and retrospective sessions. Collaborated with Front-End teams to assist with React development. PROJECTS
OddsPickr.io January 2023
● Full-stack application that is designed to help users monitor betting odds for upcoming sporting events. The backend, built on Spring Boot, utilizes Firebase API for efficient data storage and phone number validation. The front-end is developed using Flutter, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface. Users can explore and track odds for different sports and benefit from accurate currency conversion using Java Money. Lombok is utilized to enhance code readability.
● For seamless communication, it integrates Twilio API to send real-time SMS updates, leveraging a cron scheduler for timely notifications. OpenApi Swagger-Ui is enabled, facilitating easy API requests and interactions.
● Security is a priority, with Java Security implemented to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data. Firebase is also employed for authentication, offering a secure and seamless login experience. IsitZipf’s? May 2021
● Developed a Full-Stack Application enabling users to assess compliance with Zipf's Law for a given site or file. Django 3 powers the Backend, while Bootstrap 5 drives the Frontend. The Bokeh Visualization Library generates an interactive Zipf's graph showcasing the top 100 words, their frequencies, and ranks.
● User-provided site data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, automatically updating if the site undergoes changes. An algorithm computes a similarity percentage to an ideal Zipf's graph. Site parsing relies on Python's BeautifulSoup4 and Requests libraries, while file parsing utilizes BeautifulSoup4, PyPDF2, and Pytesseract for image text extraction. Language validation employs Langdetect and Regex, supporting English, Spanish, German, and Italian. Certifications
● AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) Amazon Web Services (AWS) Issued Aug ‘23
