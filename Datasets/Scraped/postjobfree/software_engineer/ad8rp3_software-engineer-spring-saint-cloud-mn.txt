Performed code reviews for software engineers resulting in more decipherable code and easier code maintainability.
Executed application migrations through the food-chain of environments using Git and Jenkins.
Executed manual uploads of migrations, charges and credits for tenants and their rented properties.
Software Engineer, Oct 2020 - Sep 2022
Travelers Insurance, St. Paul, MN
Designed, wrote, tested, deployed, supported, refactored code and enhanced Spring Boot J2EE applications (the Macroservice and its Microservices) for replicating legacy data on the Mainframe (IMS and DB2) to MongoDB both synchronously and asynchronously.
Performed code reviews for software engineers resulting in more decipherable code and easier code maintainability.
Mentored software engineers, provided guidance on coding best practices and more thorough unit, functional, integration and system tests.
Executed application migrations through the food-chain of environments using Git and Jenkins.
Resolved Log4J security vulnerabilities by converting code to use Logback.
Executed a Spring Boot 2.6.x upgrade which also included an upgrade from JUnit4 to JUnit5.
Senior Engineer, Sep 2019 - Jul 2020
B2B Technology, Target Corporation, Minneapolis, MN
Resolved numerous daily incidents and drove development stories to completion for the existing Item Mainframe and Distributed systems.
Utilized Postman for supplying data needed for different APIs in different Distributed applications in Target's Item ecosystem.
Deployed new and existing code changes for the Mainframe and Distributed platforms around Target product items.
Was a key technical leader and mentored, provided guidance on coding best practices for all other team members.
Performed code reviews for software engineers resulting in more decipherable code and easier code maintainability.
Provided 24/7 primary/secondary on-call support for all Target Item systems.
E-Business Engineer IV, Apr 2006 - Apr 2019
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN
Technical Lead and a developer on the Payments Technical Transition team for rewriting the existing Mainframe Federal Automated Clearing House (FedACH) Back-Office payment system to be a suite of SOA J2EE applications on the Distributed platform using AIX, WebSphere (WAS), Java, JMS, Oracle, OpenJPA and Spring frameworks.
Maintained all upper AIX environment deployments for QA, customer testing (DIT) and Production.
Created and presented Java programming examples to simplify training the Mainframe staff in preparation of the transition of the existing Mainframe FedACH Back-Office Payments system to a new Distributed platform.
Executed infrastructure currency upgrades for the FedLine Transaction System (FLTS).
Performed code reviews for software engineers resulting in more decipherable code and easier code maintainability.
Wrote on-line and batch programming specifications for numerous projects.
Led, designed, data modeled, wrote, tested and deployed a Mainframe solution (Data Delivery Architecture or DDA) for transmitting data from the Mainframe to the Distributed platform and back with messaging (using MQ Series) and DB2 for the FedACH Back-Office transition.
Mentored technical staff, provided guidance for software applications (both external (such as IBM) and those written internally), the different programming languages and system designs.
Technical Engineer, Apr 1994 - Apr 2006
The Musicland Group/Best Buy, Minnetonka, MN 55425
Led technical aspects for a new replacement Distribution Center (DC) for Musicland, starting with analysis all the way through deployment as well as numerous system enhancements after deployment.
Led technical efforts for upgrading DB2 version 6 to version 7 for Musicland as well as an operating system upgrade from OS/390 to z/OS.
Collaborated with Best Buy’s ASM transition team in transferring support responsibility of Musicland core systems. These systems were all Mainframe using CICS, DB2, VSAM, COBOL, COBOL II, Easytrieve and CA-IDEAL.
Tuned numerous Mainframe systems in Musicland and Best Buy for optimal performance, resulting in decreased batch windows for both environments.
Converted on-line and batch CA-IDEAL (a 4GL language) applications to CICS/COBOL II.
Converted Musicland’s numerous IMS databases to DB2 and added new functionality and enhancements while performing conversions. Databases ranged from residing in high-profile/risk systems such as store inventory which was for 1400+ stores, while others were in stand-alone (self-contained) systems. This resulted in Musicland becoming a non-IMS database shop.
Wrote templates for software engineers that were ingested by a rapid application development tool (BW/Wizard) specific to CICS (on-line) applications utilizing BTL (Bridgewater Template Language). This resulted in enforced standardization of programs and logic, while ensuring consistency and reduced the time of development and ongoing maintenance dramatically.
Created and launched Musicland’s on-line development in CICS.
Developed templates for different programming tasks utilizing many Mainframe languages utilized by software engineers for batch or on-line development, resulting in enforced programming standards and reduced the time needed for ongoing development and maintenance.
Wrote countless “in house” utilities that were utilized by software engineers, resulting in making day-to-day technical tasks easier. Performed code reviews for software engineers.
Designed and wrote on-line and batch programming specifications for software engineers.
Led technical efforts of many projects as well as the gathering of requirements from the users and assignment of development tasks for software engineers. Led e-commerce functions, which included administering database design, data modeling and technical leadership for Musicland.
Delivered a business to track finances, inventory, shipping and receiving through deployment of a system using a virtual Distribution Center (DC) within a physical DC.
Mentored technical staff, provided guidance pertaining to software applications, programming languages and system designs as well as many other technical areas including IBM and Musicland “in house” utilities.
Responsible for the analysis, design, data modeling, database design, development, testing and deployment of numerous new Mainframe systems as well as ongoing maintenance/enhancements of numerous existing Mainframe systems.
Provided 24/7 primary/secondary on-call support for all Mainframe systems.
