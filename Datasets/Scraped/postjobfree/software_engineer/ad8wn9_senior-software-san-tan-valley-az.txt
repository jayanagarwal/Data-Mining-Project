First, and foremost, I am an engineer. This means if you are using a tool not on my resume, don’t worry I’ll pick it up very fast. Not just that, I’ll learn how it works under-the-hood. If you need something designed from scratch, I’m your person. I create things, not just build them. If I need a tool for something and one doesn’t exist, I’ll create it.

As a senior software engineer, I am very comfortable dealing with problems from the architectural level down to the code level. I’m as comfortable on the Linux command line as I am in any IDE. I rarely run applications on my desktop, I build Docker containers for them, and link them to other containers (databases etc.).

I collaborate with cross-functional teams.
I write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
I am very comfortable working in a peer-review system, and love mentoring.
I use debugging, performance analysis, and ADA compliance tools on the front-end.
I have a love for automation.
I stay up to date with industry stadards and what’s new, by regularly taking part in discussions (cspace, webdev, quora, etc.), and attend conferences when I can.
I have a very professional attitude to my work, and easily fit into any team.
I use JetBrains products because they all work great.

EMPLOYMENT:
The gap between my last contract and now is because of multiple deaths in my family. This meant I had to go back to my home country (UK) to be with family. After I came back to the US, I took a month off to do some travelling and to refocus.
