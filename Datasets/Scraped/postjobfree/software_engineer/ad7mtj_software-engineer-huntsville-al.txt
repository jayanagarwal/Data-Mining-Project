Duties, Accomplishments and Related Skills
-Developed simulation software for rocket engine & controller, fuel tank, ground telescope etc.:
:
• Developed non-real-time simulation model of fuel tank for rocket engine.The model simulated the requirements for the tank using C & Matlab/Simulink programming language on a Window PC.
For this task, I was given 5 requirements to develop the non-real-time simulation SW:
+I developed the flow charts which described the flow of my SW.
+Brief description of the characteristics of the tank.
+My approach to develop models respectively.
+Simulated both models & verified against the requirements.
+Trade studies on advantages & disadvantages for using these 2 languages.
• Developed real-time simulation model of MC-1 Engine for LCBT (Low Cost Boost Technology) project using ADRTS (Applied Dynamic Real Time System) programming language on Unix system. The model was tested in the lab to verify the controller model (developed by another engineer), which was used for hot-fire tests for MC-1 Engine at test stand.
For this task, MC-1 Engine was designed at MSFC. I was given the table look-up of the propulsion data (pressure, temperature, and valves-schedule)
& the SW model (real time) was developed based on these data. The model was run in the lab with hardware in the loop with the controller (both SW & HW). The controller SW was used in the hot fires with a similar controller HW at Stennis Space Center.
+ADRTS is the computer system which was built by a company in Michigan. The programming language was RTS run on this system on Unix operating system.
• Developed real-time simulation model of SSME (Space Shuttle Main Engine) using ADRTS programming language on Unix system for Quick-Fire II project. For this task, a different method to hot fire the SSME was developed at MSFC. My task was to develop the SW model with ADRTS with this hot fire method. The controller SW model (developed by another engineer) was tested in the lab before it was taken down to STFC for hot fire.
• Developed non-real-time simulation model of the Segment Alignment Maintenance System (SAMS) Matrix Generator. The calculation of the boundary condition were initially written in Matlab scripts. Those scripts were translated into C programming language, then compiled and run on a Sun (Unix) system. The C programs were eventually implemented in Labview. This task was for HET
(Hobby-Eberly Telescope) project.
The Segment Alignment Maintenance System (SAMS) was installed on McDonald Observatory’s Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) in August 2001. The SAMS became fully operational in October 2001. The SAMS uses a system of 480 inductive edge sensors to correct misalignments of the HET’s 91 primary mirror segments when the segments are perturbed from their aligned reference positions.
• Developed non-real-time simulation model for GPS receiver in C on Unix system for RITAT (Robust Integration Technology and Testbed) project. For this task, my job was to develop the simulation SW for a GPS simulator on UNIX operating system in C. I tested the SW model successfully by injecting simulated data. (The SW was supposed to test with the rate table in the lab (3-dof). I believed the project was canceled due to lack of funding.
-Supported CLV (Crew Launch Vehicle) project as software insight:
• Reviewed and provided comments on controller software specification requirements, software configuration management, software test procedures, and software safety documents etc.
For this task, my job was to review the controller system specifications document & provided feedback (SW safety, configuration management, SW design document were also review). The controller was developed by Rocketdyne. (EX: the purge sequences of the controller SW, shutdown & post shutdown requirements for the SW etc.)
-Researched and studied software life cycle models (Agile, Incremental, Iterative, Spiral and Waterfall).
-Presented the MC-1 software model of MC-1 Engine at the 2002 RTS (Real-Time System) conference.
• Group achievement awards: This award is for outstanding project accomplishment for the group or subgroup (LCBT and HET). Jobs Related Awards:
• Personal Performance awards: Individual outstanding achievement - Low Cost Boost Technology project.
• Software of the Year award (group): Best software award for the whole center - Hobby-Eberly Telescope project.
