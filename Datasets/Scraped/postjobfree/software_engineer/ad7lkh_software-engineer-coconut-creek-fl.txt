Summary
I work at T-Systems as a Senior Software Engineer, developing payment APIs in Java for about 7 months.
With over 10 years of experience in Software Engineering, I have consistently focused on developing and enhancing robust authentication solutions.
During my time at Itaú Unibanco, I had the opportunity to lead the development of back-end and front-end applications focused on authentication, playing a crucial role in implementing FIDO, CIAM, STS, iToken, and various other financial products. My competencies include Java, Spring Boot, AWS, OAuth, among others. At CVC CORP, I delved into the world of log applications, utilizing tools such as Terraform, Ansible, and Kafka, always in AWS environments. Additionally, as a Software Quality Engineer, I specialized in test automation, using languages and tools such as Ruby, Selenium, JMeter, Python, and many others.
Besides my work in corporate environments, I am passionate about personal projects and the constant improvement of my technical skills. I have experimented with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Lua, Kotlin, and Python, to create game applications and other projects that spark my curiosity. These projects have been both an opportunity to learn new programming languages and a way to challenge myself to solve complex problems in new ways. Through these personal projects, I have gained a deeper understanding of each language and improved my ability to quickly adapt my skills to new challenges. Experience
