Resume as of July 30, 2024
I’m a Sr. Angular, Node, Typescript Engineer who is a results-oriented professional with vision, and a solid performance record of accomplishment. I am an experienced A.I. programmer since 2018 where I built an A.I. for Digital Harbor from scratch in Angular and converted it to an NPM Module for enterprise-wide distribution. I'll show you that while invention requires the creation of new ideas, processes or products, innovation moves one step further and requires implementation of the inventive act. Innovation also implies a value system which seeks to derive a positive outcome from the inventive act, and finally, I don't look backwards for very long... I ‘KEEP MOVING FORWARD’, opening up new doors and doing new things, because I’m curious and curiosity keeps leading me down new paths. PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
