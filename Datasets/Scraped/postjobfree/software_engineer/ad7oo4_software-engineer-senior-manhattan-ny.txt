Data Visualization Web App
Dataflexor is a side project of mine. It's a web app that reads spreadsheet data, processes them, and visualizes them with charts. The app can read multiple file types and data sources (Google sheets, Excel, CSV, JSON.) and will unify them. It has strong data processing capabilities to provide the users with multiple functionalities to prepare their data (filtering, trimming, grouping, aggregating, mapping) in a no-code fashion. After the data is unified and prepared, it will be visualized and the user can explore correlations,trends, and general statistics.
Elementor based Website for Fire-Resistant Wood Construction Company I revamped a project on WordPress CMS with fresh branding for seamless content management. Using elementor page builder, I leveraged its templating feature for efficient design. Implemented proper schema for SEO enhancement and developed various landing pages catering to different target audiences. Additionally, custom features including File directory, image gallery, and CPTs were meticulously crafted using React/Next and Javascript to augment functionality.
