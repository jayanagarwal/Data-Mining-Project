● The main components are:
o Boundary Filter :
assigning instruments to a specific business model
maintaining (CRUD operations) executable sub graph (ESG) instructions o Graph Database: repository for business model templates and ESG o Graph Partitioner: assigning ESGs to available execution engines/partitions o Partition Database: repository of deployment instructions per execution engine/partition o Engine Manager: maintenance of available execution engines o Execution Engine: deploying ESG instruments and triggering execution of calculation nodes Golden Tree Asset Management 05/2014-10/2014
