SDET, NumPy Ninja
Oct 2023 – present
• Developed and implemented an automation framework from inception, resulting in a 70% increase in testing team, a 60% improvement in test accuracy, and a significant 55% reduction in test maintenance costs.
• Participated in 7-day sprints for software testing (hackathons) to challenge and enhance self-learning.
Project: LMS - A Learning management system, a tool which can be used by educational institutions to host their curriculum and hub for online community.
Responsibilities:
• Responsible for designing test cases and executing them within an AGILE software development SCRUM environment
• Conducted Functional testing with Eclipse TestNG, Selenium WebDriver, Maven, Java, for web-based applications.
• Responsible for creating Cucumber-BDD automation framework using Selenium WebDriver, Java and TestNG/Junit from scratch. • I extensively wrote granular Gherkin scenarios using Behavior- Driven Development (BDD). I utilized the BDD-Cucumber framework to automate test scripts, develop scenarios, scenario outlines, data tables, features, and step definitions.
• Implemented the Page Object Model and Page Factory in the framework to write UI automation scripts as an integral part of the software development lifecycle.
• Developed and maintained automated test frameworks using Java and integrated dependency injection principles with Pico Container to manage object lifecycles and dependencies efficiently.
• Implemented data-driven testing with Selenium, Java, TestNG, and JUnit for UI automation, boosting test coverage by 60% and enhancing application quality and stability by 75%
• Implemented Test-Driven Development (TDD) for the application, resulting in early-stage bug detection and reducing defect fixing costs by 50% and development time by 30%
• Generated post-test execution cucumber, allure, and extent spark reports.
• Implemented parallel execution, reducing total execution time by 40%.
• Utilized GitHub for version control and followed pull request code review process for code merge within the team which resulted in 80% improvement in coding efficiency.
• Hands-on experience with the basic installation of Jenkins and job configuration for continuous integration and continuous development.
• Worked with PostgreSQL for SQL query optimization which involved the execution of queries to retrieve and analyze data.
• Configured JIRA boards and workflows to streamline team collaboration and improve project visibility.
Project: DS Algo - Automated testing for web-based application dedicated to in-depth learning of data structures, ensuring comprehensive test coverage across all modules.
