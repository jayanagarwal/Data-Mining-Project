Professional Experiences
Senior Front-end Engineer PFGC
April 2023 - Till date IL, USA
-Developed web applications to enhance the e-commerce platform, optimizing inventory management and supply chain efficiency, enabling over 1000 convenience stores to place orders seamlessly. And successfully collaborated with an agile, cross-functional team (product management, design, backend, DevOps) to deliver new features on time, resulting in a 20% increase in platform adoption.
-We utilized Material-UI (MUI) components to create responsive and visually consistent web pages, improving user engagement by 15% across all device types.
-We have implemented an E2E testing suite using PCloudify, ensuring comprehensive real-world testing, which reduced post-deployment bugs by 25%.
Achievements:
-Optimized Page Load Times and Reduced Bounce Rates: Identified and resolved performance issues in the e-commerce platform by implementing code splitting and lazy loading using Reacts built-in features. This reduced the initial JavaScript bundle size by 50%, leading to a 40% faster initial load time and a 25% reduction in bounce rates.
- Implemented caching Strategies: Utilized browser caching for static assets and server-side caching for API responses, reducing the number of repeated requests and improving load times for returning users by 25%.
- Deployed Static Assets to CDN: Leveraged a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for serving static assets, significantly improving content delivery speed and reducing server load, which resulted in a 20% increase in website performance.

Front-end Engineer IBX
January 2022 - March 2023 PA, USA
-Developed a comprehensive health monitoring dashboard integrating real-time patient data, including vitals, medical history, and appointment scheduling. Utilized React, Redux, and Socket.io for real-time updates, improving healthcare provider efficiency by 25%.
-Enhanced the telehealth platform by adding video consultation features using WebRTC, enabling secure and high-quality virtual patient-doctor interactions. Collaborated closely with product design, backend, and DevOps teams, resulting in a 30% increase in virtual consultation appointments.
-Maintained and improved a mature mono repo managed with TurboRepo, incorporating custom scripts to enhance code and type reusability. Streamlined CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and delivery, reducing deployment times by 20%.
-Led the rebuild of a legacy patient management application using Fastify BFFs (Backend for Frontend) and tRPC (end-to-end typesafe), integrated with React Query. Achieved a 30% reduction in backend response times, improving overall system performance and patient data retrieval speed.
Achievements:
-Optimized Real-time Data Handling: Optimized real-time data handling for patient monitoring by implementing efficient data flow and decoupling dependencies using IoC (Inversion of Control) and DI (Dependency Injection) patterns. This improved system scalability and reliability, handling a 20% increase in concurrent users.
-Implemented Secure Communication Channels: Implemented secure communication channels for patient-doctor interactions by integrating end-to-end encryption for all data transmissions.
