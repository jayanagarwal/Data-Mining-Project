Hello, I’m Antonio Irizarry. I am a seasoned software engineer and designer with over 15
years of experience in branding and web development. My passion for web development began at 15 when I created rudimentary WordPress sites, which eventually led to professional software development, mainly with Ruby on Rails. I have worked with successful startups in Chicago and New York City, and my unique blend of skills has earned me a reputation as a digital innovator. After years of working independently as a consultant, I realized the value of collaboration and now seek to work with a team where I can contribute my skills and continue to grow. My expertise spans project management, client relations, and UI/UX design, with a strong focus on delivering top-quality, user- centered products. I love what I do
and
I would love to work for you.
Get in touch.
