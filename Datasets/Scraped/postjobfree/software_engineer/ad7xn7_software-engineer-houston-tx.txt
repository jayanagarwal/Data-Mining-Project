Software Engineer
Created custom billing interface for hospitals that used our proprietary pharmacy software. They were configured to be Y2K ready by changing a configuration flag. This was done using Dataflex (DOS based) This improved the accuracy and speed of our billing.
Maintained and modified a Contract Management System using Power Builder 6.5. I added new functionality per user requirements as well as fixed bugs as needed.
I am currently responsible for nearly 20 web based applications which are written in various versions of .net framework (1.0 thru 3.5). One of which is going commercial and 2 Power Builder 6.5 client server applications.
On priority applications we plan quarterly releases. I gather user requirements and document them for user acceptance and QA. The releases generally include bug fixes as well as knew requirements. On the older more stable apps I generally do emergency bug fixes as they arise, also new requirements occasionally.
I have done extensive SQL work between writing/modifying stored procedures and working with DTS and SSIS packages. Often bugs result in invalid data that must be researched and cleaned up as well.
I generally work directly with my users. I have worked on teams to help them understand how the apps I support function. I also work well with our DBA’s and Web Services as needed.
I have experience with ASP.Net, C#.Net, Crystal Reports 9.0, SSRS, MS BizTalk Server 2004, MS SQL Server 2000, ASP, JavaScript, VB Script, Visual Basic 5.0, Power Builder 6.5, DataFlex. I’ve been coding in .Net since 10/2003, SQL Server much longer.
