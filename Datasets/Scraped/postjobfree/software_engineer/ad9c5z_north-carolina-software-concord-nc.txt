Work Experience
UNC School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Aug 2019 – May 2021
Undergraduate Research Assistant: Mucociliary Clearance and Aerosol Research Laboratory
Developed Python image processing program to pinpoint regions of high and low particle deposition in respiratory tract using images produced by gamma scintigraphy
Assisted in clinical studies of various aerosol (e-cig, wood smoke, hypertonic saline) deposition in the respiratory tract using gamma scintigraphy to generate images
Ran studies on polydispersed aerosols with cascade impactors to generate data associated with particle size and deposition in the respiratory tract
Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Aug 2018 – May 2019
Researcher: Ultrasound Imaging and Transcranial Super-Resolution Imaging Laboratory
Developed 3D CAD models for securing transducer in experimental setup of simulation of transcranial ultrasound
Performed experiments using the models and transducer to image objects ranging from standing wires to moving microbubbles
Fixed blurry images by developing new model for experimental setup and redesigning transducer holder
Projects
Machine Learning Translation Model Web Application June 2022 – Jan 2023
Carnegie Mellon University
Designed and implemented machine learning pipeline for web application to translate audio from user-uploaded videos. Applied noise reduction by spectral subtraction and used LAS and XLSR for training and testing transcriptions. Post-processed transcriptions for profanity censoring.
Deep Neural Networks, Deep CNNs October 2021 – May 2022
Carnegie Mellon University
Implemented and trained these algorithms using SGD under different cost functions in Python and adjusted hyperparameters to minimize validation error. Built deep CNN for image classification using PyTorch.
Decision Trees, NLP Logistic Classifier, Hidden Markov Models, Q-Learning Linear Func. Aug – Dec 2021
Carnegie Mellon University
Designed and implemented each of these models in Python for training on large datasets. Models were then tested on validation datasets and the errors were compared.
Electronic Periodontal Probe Prototype Jan 2021 – May 2021
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
Wrote script for the microcontroller of electronic periodontal probe that indicated the proper amount of pressure to be applied during probing for a more accurate assessment of a patients’ progression of periodontitis
GUI for Automating Image Analysis of Hot and Cold Spots in Lung Deposition 2019 – 2021
Mucoclliary Clearance and Aerosol Research Laboratory
Self-directed project using Python to automate the image processing and analysis of lung images produced by gamma scintigraphy. Interface outputs patients hot and cold spots after user selects images.
Data Structures Development Aug – Dec 2019
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
Created several different data structures including Binary Search Trees, Binary Heaps, Splay Trees, and Weighted Digraphs for organizing and retrieving records of names and ages
Simulation of Transcranial Super-Resolution Imaging Jan – June 2019
Ultrasound Imaging and Transcranial Super-Resolution Imaging Laboratory
Designed Ultrasound transducer holder using SolidWorks and Adobe Illustrator
Laser-cut and 3D printed parts to assemble transducer holder
Repeated experiment using trial and error techniques to improve the resolution and minimize movement of the transducer
GUI Sushi Conveyor Belt Game Jan – May 2019
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
Developed GUI for sushi belt game in Java using OOP. Interface generates customizable sushi dishes under user-defined conditions such as price and position on the belt.
