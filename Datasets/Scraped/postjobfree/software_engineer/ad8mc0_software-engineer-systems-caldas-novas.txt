The program used 500 KBytes, but with the memory limit per program still at 64 KBytes, I created a communication queue for COBOL programs, with a main COBOL program that triggered the execution of 10 identical programs that stored 50 KBytes of matrices, each with a communication mask, with parameters allowing commands to indicate which matrix, which command, clean, initialize, read, write, and the variable and element index.

Through a call from a BPL program that passed the Fortran program parameters to the main COBOL program, which then activated the corresponding COBOL program via the communication queue containing the desired variable. The Fortran program itself was divided into several overlays.

A successful CASE – 2007/02 – 2009/03

At Fast Solutions, address Rua Heitor Peixoto, 711,
cep 01544-000, São Paulo, SP, +55-11-291*-****.

Where Banco Real's VISA Vale Toll System was in production, which was developed over 6 years, in PHP, Oracle, PL/SQL, HTML, Java Script, including the ticketing module developed by a company in Uruguay.

The person who developed the system, made a patchwork quilt, where a lot of data was constantly changed from one variable to another, without reasons, causing extreme difficulty of tracking by XREF.

Furthermore, the data in the system was completely unstable, due to conceptual, logical and operational errors.

They called me for an interview in the afternoon and I started the next day in the morning despite living in Campinas.

The pressure on whoever had made the software was intense due to the serious problems in the system, and Banco Real was the company's “advertising” customer.

He couldn't fix so many problems anymore and he freaked out.

He left the company giving me only the information of where the software was installed.

I got this system without any manual documentation or even internally in the programs.

I put out the fire over the course of 2 to 3 months, and then I had to prove through audit reports that there were problems in other stages of the system that did not belong to our software or our production.

The first to be resolved was Miami VISA, which I managed to prove that the robot to upload the files sometimes did not upload but confirmed that they had received it, and this caused serious discrepancies, generating false alerts for the Bank.

The same happened because they did not take into account the fact that it is normal for some card charges to remain in an indefinite status and consequently with the wrong balance, due to hasty handling when loading the card.
After numerous reports from my audit, I was able to prove that I knew what I was doing, and that our system was correct, not needing these Miami checks, even more so with misinterpretations, with that Miami VISA left the circuit, stopping the noise it caused in production.

The second was VISA (Brazil), where I showed errors arising from the lack of data consistency, in the common cases in which the card passes through toll booths in remote places in Brazil that are sometimes temporarily without electricity.

They asked for a suggestion and I gave it to them: because there were manual processes occasionally, it was necessary to check the card's check digits, as well as the toll values posted, which used to be below something around 100 Reals, and VISA let it go a toll value of 20 thousand Reals.

They accepted and resolved.

The third was with the company from Uruguay, which did the ticketing, but due to a logic error when there was duplicity, they still did the Update, which changed the date, removing an event of a month already consolidated, and playing in another, causing a lot of confusion.

And then they fixed the code as I instructed, and the problem was solved.

And then finally, after many audit reports, we were able to prove to the carriers that the problems that remained were not ours, but simply that they had not adopted a new protocol that had existed for a while, but that required development, on their side, but they didn't do it because it was too costly and our system was completely full of errors, and it was no use for them to improve on their side.

But when we got our entire system right, the pressure on them from the Bank was enough for them to make the necessary adaptations.

And then the system was in order...

On one occasion, there was terrible pressure on me for a mistake that was actually caused by the bank and the plasterer, producing magnetic cards with a layout of an earlier version, or something like that, and I managed to prove that I and our company had no responsibility for the operational consequences, where even truck drivers protested at the doors of transport companies.

If the system had still been wrong, things would have turned ugly for us, because before me, our company was always to blame for everything.
I corrected some of our internal operating procedures, and made a program that corrected a very common operating error when processing the same batch again by mistake.

Two years after I started, the system didn't need me for anything else, and so I left the company, where I worked informally, with all the autonomy granted by the IT Director, who understood the importance and quality of my work.

The director, in turn, joined the company at the request of the owner, who had great references of him, and his character, to try to end the dominance of several employees over the operational KNOW HOW that was kept secret by them, leaving the company hostage to them.

But the director couldn't stand that IT environment, which was one of the most poisonous I've ever known, and he left about 3 months before me.

And so without the director, who gave me autonomy and had wisdom in decisions, I also decided to leave, staying only until it was confirmed that the whole system that I fixed was running wonderfully without the need for any intervention on my part.

I only left when I finalized everything that needs to be fixed in the system, and leaving was very healthy for me.

But before toasting, I made programs to generate internal audit reports, to help them locate possible third-party errors, if needed.

A few months before everything went back to normal, I was asked to write an official report to be the basis of Banco Real's negotiations for the sale of the software, the product and the portfolio of customers related to the product.

Due to the indeterminate statuses that occurred, when the person loading the cards removed them before completion, the question remained whether the card was loaded or not.

And to find out the balance, the last load with valid status was needed, which I used to calculate the total MINIMUM amount existing on the active cards.

And he also had to add the values of the undefined status after this valid charge, in order to calculate the MAXIMUM total value existing on the cards.

And so the bank and the applicants for the purchase of the product would know the range of values, between the maximum and the minimum, of all the active charges on all the cards, to take into account when evaluating the value of the product and its consequent negotiation.
In view of this, my audit reports had to be very accurate, clear, transparent and convincing, accompanied by tangible and auditable evidence, including methodology, and programming code.

Due to the computational and querying complexity for which the logical architecture of the database was not designed, as well as the small and slow physical infrastructure, it was to be expected that it could take an excessive amount of time.

For that, I made the program in PL/SQL, but running it only for a tiny amount of data, and the time it took was a lot.

I made a projection of how long it would take, and it turned out to be disastrous, as it would take many days, competing with the system in production, and it could still be finished ahead of time for other reasons.

So I looked for another solution.

I exported from Oracle, only the necessary data fields, and even simplifying the various codes and indexes, to make them smaller.

And I created tables on FoxPro Server, on a server disconnected from the network, and completely dedicated to this task, and I imported the data.

So I made a program in Visual FoxPro, and I ran it overnight. In the morning it was ready.

Then there was the long work of producing the official audit reports.

And so, even with many trying to knock me down since I joined the company, I gained the respectability of having managed to do everything necessary, far beyond expectations, as I entered into technical contacts with all the companies involved, showing solutions and assertiveness.
