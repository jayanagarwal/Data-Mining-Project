Collections Manager for this large Continuous passive motion (CPM) rental firm. Followed up on claims with all major insurance companies and patients who receive payments from insurers, When necessary I appealed claims that were denied incorrectly. I also sued insurers such as United Healthcare and never lost a case. When patients were paid by insurers and were supposed to reimburse us, they often did not do so. If calls and letters were ignored, we initiated action in Small Claims Court. We never lost a case. The volume of claims we processed was large as we normally had 100 machines in rental service.
