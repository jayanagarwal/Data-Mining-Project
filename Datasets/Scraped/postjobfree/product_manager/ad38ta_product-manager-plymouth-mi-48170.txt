This workflow is instantiated by the message broker platform which passes the Teamworks process a set of document identifying parameters.
End user will enter details such as selecting business format and approvers, who will be involved in different levels of approval, using web forms. There are 40 web forms available in .Net application. Once web forms are submitted, the .Net application will create CSV and PDF files out of it. These files will be stored in SharePoint and a shared folder. User has the provision to upload required additional documents, for different approval processes, in SharePoint.
Knowledge Lake, a batch process, will poll the folder for new documents. When the documents are stored in shared folder, Knowledge Lake will read the document and will create XML payload file.
