Work Experience
Business Program Manager, AARP Volunteer Portal
07/2014 – 11/2023, AARP, Washington, DC
I served as the Business Program Manager for the Volunteer Technology Modernization
(VTM) Program, which launched AARP’s New Volunteer Portal on October 6, 2015. This first phase of the Volunteer Portal was delivered on time and on budget, which was a challenge considering all the competing priorities, but definitely to the credit of over forty consultants who worked on the all aspects of Phase 1 as well as the focus of our volunteer program partners in the VTM Business Product Council (BPC) and the continuous support of the VTM Executive Sponsor and the Executive Steering Committee for the effort. In the role of Program Manager, I serve in a number of different capacities:
• Partner to the IT Program Manager, to ensure that business needs remain the focus of the initiative
• Liaison between the IT Team and the BPC, ensuring that IT is able to meet the needs of the programs effectively
• Collaborative coordinator between AARP’s volunteer programs, focused on ensuring that all the programs have a “voice” in the evolution of the portal while also recognizing that the volunteer programs at AARP need to share a common process for engaging with volunteers
• As Product Owner, I serve as the strategic decision maker for the initiative
• To ensure the end user is included in the development of the platform, volunteers are invited to offer the “voice of the volunteer” as a guide to the program
• Acted as the key interface between the program and the Executive Sponsor and Executive Steering Committee, bringing challenges and successes for advice and coaching
AARP’s Volunteer Portal is an exciting resource and tool for AARP’s nearly 60,000 volunteers today and holds the promise of being an evolving resource for current and future AARP volunteers and volunteer programs. While focused on volunteer management, this platform also allows for improved volunteer program management. In Phase 5 in 2019, we migrated Volunteer Portal to Salesforce Lightning, the latest user interface for Salesforce. We migrated nearly 500 Staff users in March, 2019 and nearly 45,000 Volunteer users in August, 2019. In Phase 6 of the initiative in 2020, the two major initiatives for the program are to expand functionality that supports Driver Safety Courses by allowing for online registration and payment for course participants and digital roster management for instructors and hosts, as well as the replacement of the Learning Management System. In 2023 I supported 10 volunteer programs and sub-programs utilizing Volunteer Portal.
