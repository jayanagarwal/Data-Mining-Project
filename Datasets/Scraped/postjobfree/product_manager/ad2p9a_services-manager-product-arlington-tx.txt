SENIOR WEB SERVICES MANAGER

I am a results-driven Senior Support Services Manager with over 20 years of experience in leading cross-functional international teams to success. My career has been marked by achievements such as managing a team of 16 employees across the US and Serbia with zero turnover for five consecutive years, significantly increasing storefront capacity, and implementing efficient ticket-based support systems that reduced complaints by 50%. I have a strong background in Solutioning, SAAS storefronts, B2B e-commerce, and omnichannel marketing campaign management. I excel in product management, strategy analytics, fostering innovation and collaboration. I am eager to bring my leadership, collaboration, and problem-solving skills to a dynamic team.
