PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES
Computer Networking Laboratory at New Jersey Institute of Technology Newark, NJ
Assistant Researcher and Software /Networking Lab Instructor Sep 2008 – Current
● Used C++ with OpenCV to optimize two factors in the algorithm by decreasing the false negative rate of the owner recognition and the false-positive rate of a non-owner recognition rate in the smart gun project.
● Developed features of transferring data from the sensors on the gun grips to the digital signals from the processor with C++ and QT in smart gun project, experienced with Agile and scrum.
● Applied and analyzed statistical methods to model the data counting error rate,
● Designed and enhanced online data transaction protocols’ robustness and security by using different encryption methods such as RSA, ring signature, three pass algorithm and optimal data structure design to well mitigate major types of attacks through the different party in E-voting related projects.
● Improved the accuracy of the data transaction, decreased the attack successful rate on a system which is closed to zero.
● Simulated and tested the worst scenario in designed protocols and applied a random permutation to satisfy and address the E-voting system's’ attack-free, high performance, and confidentiality requirement.
• Generated and optimized the definition and format of the digital ballot solution to enhance security, privacy, and confidentiality with great performance in E-voting projects.
● Launched a series of Internet-based electronic voting protocols offering great benefits over traditional methods in areas such as protecting users privacy, providing accurate data counting, preventing fraudulent and etc
● Proposed various algorithms and protocols for security and privacy risk analysis, system performance statistics, cryptography application, data structure design, protocols simulation and etc.
● Created and supervised C, C++ project framework to help students make project and performance analysis in class.
