- Wrote government proposals regarding AI Data-Readiness frameworks

Data Scientist
10/2022 to 01/2024
Gemological Institute of America – remote
- Built machine learning (ML) and neural network models for valuing diamonds, steps included hyperparameter tuning, architecture comparisons, and evaluation metrics (accuracy/precision for classifiers, RMSE and R-Squared for regressors)
- Designed deep learning neural networks for Computer Vision object detection for diamond clarity as well as time-series forecasting of instrumentation failure with algorithms: CNN’s, ResNet, DenseNet, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM’s), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU’s)
- Built numerical models with ML algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and ensemble methods)
- Built Power BI / Tableau dashboards to track performance across regions the organization (Month- over-Month charts, matrix tables, filters, date slicers, etc.)
- Extracted data from Snowflake and IBM Cloudant API’s before preprocessing data, boto3, S3, and SageMaker for model development
- Performed exploratory data analysis to identify outliers, NaN values, statistical measures, and data visualizations (aggregations, barplots, heatmaps, Pearson correlations, etc.)
- Presented management with findings (evaluation metrics, features, algorithms, architectures, graphs)

// EDUCATION

Master of Science, Artificial Intelligence
09/2021 to 09/2022
Dublin Business School - Dublin, Ireland
* Coursework
o Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Recommender Systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Programming for Data Analysis, Graph Theory, Cognitive & Ethical Dimensions of AI Dissertation
o A comparison study of LSTM and GRU algorithms and a feature analysis of multivariate macroeconomic features pertaining to their capacity to improve accuracy of Bitcoin price predictions. https://anders-kiss.gitbook.io/modeling- digital-assets-with-deep-learning/
* Projects
o A data acquisition / preprocessing pipeline script to obtain stock market data, create technical indicator, with data persisting to a database (Microsoft SQL Server). https://github.com/Anderche/data-acquisition-and-preprocessing- pipeline
o A Content-based recommender system (RS) script is for a content-based recommender system (RS) that I built. This basic system recommends an Airbnb listing to a User based on the description fields of a their historical stays. The code implementation compares recommendation accuracy of the BERT and TF-IDF algorithms. https://github.com/Anderche/content-based-recommendation-system o An NLP topic modeling application to better understand the major themes for that day’s news headlines by ingesting the Python API, NewsAPI. It can be found here: https://github.com/Anderche/Natural-Language-Processing_Topic- Modeling
A Python script that utilizes that targets communities from the MovieLens database (containing ~38,000 movies) via the graph theory (machine learning) algorithms, Label Propagation (Community Detection Algorithm), and K-Nearest Neighbors (Similarity Algorithm). https://github.com/Anderche/graph-theory-profitable-movie-ideas o A Tensorflow / Keras image classification model compared the accuracy of three image classification models: ResNet50, VGG16, and a custom deep learning, neural network. For each model above, first a baseline model was trained and evaluated. Afterwards, a dropout layer was added to each model and compared in terms of the baseline models. https://github.com/Anderche/image_classification
