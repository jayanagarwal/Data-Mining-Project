Experience with BI Development
SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS):
Mr. Miller was involved in creating and deploying SSRS reports. SSRS is a powerful tool for designing, generating, and delivering interactive, tabular, graphical, or free-form reports from various data sources. It’s commonly used for BI reporting within the Microsoft ecosystem.
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS):
Mr. Miller worked as an SQL Server ETL Developer (SSIS). SSIS is a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool that allows developers to create data integration workflows. It’s particularly useful for moving and transforming data between various systems, databases, and file formats.
Microsoft Dynamics CRM:
While working with the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences, Mr. Miller integrated SSRS reports with Microsoft Dynamics CRM. CRM systems often require customized reporting solutions, and SSRS fits the bill.
Microsoft Access:
Earlier in his career, Mr. Miller developed applications using Microsoft Access. Although Access is not a full-fledged BI tool, it can be used for lightweight reporting and data analysis.
SQL Server Data Warehousing:
Mr. Miller was involved in creating data warehouses for reporting purposes. Data warehousing involves designing and maintaining large-scale databases optimized for reporting and analytics.
PowerShell:
