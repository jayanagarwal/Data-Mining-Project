With 9 years of intensive experience in the tech industry, I have had the distinct privilege of driving technological innovation within several startups, playing a pivotal role in conceptualizing and actualizing products from the ground up. My expertise spans a vast array of cutting-edge technologies and systems. In the realm of Programming Languages & Frameworks, I have harnessed advanced SQL techniques, leveraged Python for diverse scripting and ETL processes, and employed Java/Scala, especially in conjunction with platforms like Apache Kafka and Apache Spark. My work in Data Processing Systems is marked by a deep-seated proficiency in Apache Spark, real-time data processing with Apache Flink, and a thorough grasp of the Hadoop ecosystem. Within the sphere of Database & Storage Solutions, I have navigated the intricacies of various RDBMS such as PostgreSQL and MySQL, tapped into the capabilities of NoSQL platforms like MongoDB, and managed columnar and time-series databases with systems like Parquet and InfluxDB. I have an extensive background in Data Warehousing Technologies, familiarizing myself with powerhouse platforms like Amazon Redshift and Snowflake. This experience is complemented by my adeptness in Data Movement & ETL Instruments, having worked extensively with tools like Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka, and more. My skills in Data Design & Architecture have empowered startups to leverage effective data modeling techniques, from Star and Snowflake Schemas to adept normalization/denormalization strategies. This foundation is further reinforced by my expertise in cloud solutions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure platforms, as well as Infrastructure Automation Tools, streamlining processes using Terraform, CloudFormation, and Pulumi.
