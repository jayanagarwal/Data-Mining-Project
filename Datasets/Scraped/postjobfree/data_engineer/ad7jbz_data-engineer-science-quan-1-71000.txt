PROFRESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Detected disaster of Farm base on picture April 2024 – May 2024 Backend developer, Data science, MLOps
The project aims to develop a system for disease classification in agricultural settings. With the increasing demand for sustainable and efficient farming practices, early detection and management of plant diseases are crucial. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms (CNN) to classify diseases affecting crops based on visual symptoms.
Responsibility:
• Dataset Collection: Get image of potatoes and tomatoes disaster from google images and Kaggles .
• Data Processing and feature engineering: Clean data and do Image Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, scaling, cropping, translation, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, and adding noise are applied to images.
• Model Development: Build and Train machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), on the pre-processed dataset to accurately classify crop diseases.
• Deployment: deploying our trained model onto Google Cloud Platform, creating an API endpoint for seamless integration with backend systems. Leveraging the scalability and reliability of Google Cloud, we ensure our model is readily accessible for backend calls, enabling real-time predictions with minimal latency.
Technologies and Tools used:
• Programming Languages: Python, Tensorflow
• Framework: FastApi, TF Serving
• Cloud and Storage: Google Cloud Platform(GCP)
• Database: MySql,
• Tools: Postman, Github
Resource: Source code for project
Simulator Trip With Real-Time data May 2024 - June 2024 Data Engineer, Data Analytics
This project demonstrates the end-to-end responsibilities of a Data Engineer, including data ingestion, real-time processing, data transformation, and deployment of a trip simulation model. It highlights the use of modern data engineering tools and cloud platforms to build a scalable and efficient real-time trip simulation system.
Responsibility:
• Data Generation and Ingestion: includes data such as trip start and end times, locations, distances, vehicle data, and trip durations and environmental data: includes real-time traffic conditions, weather data, and road conditions.Using .

Computer Vision: Football Analyst System Feb 2024 –April 2024 Image Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning Working on the "Football Analyst System" has been a profound learning experience in the realm of image processing. Through this project, I delved deep into various image processing techniques, data crawling methodologies, and machine learning algorithms. Utilizing OpenCV and YOLOv8, it served as a comprehensive platform for honing my skills and expertise in this domain. This project provided valuable insights and practical knowledge that have significantly enriched my understanding of image processing principles and applications.
Responsibility:
• Object Detection: Used YOLO, a state-of-the-art object detector, to detect players, referees, and footballs. Additionally, trained a custom object detector to enhance the performance of the state- of-the-art models.Data Processing: Initial data cleaning image by OpenCv. Ignore noise image and then creating black and white image for training model later.
• Object Tracking: Implemented trackers to follow detected objects across frames.
• Team Assignment: Applied KMeans clustering for pixel segmentation to accurately assign players to teams based on the colors of their t-shirts.
• Camera Movement Measurement: Used optical flow to measure camera movement between frames, ensuring precise player movement tracking.
• Perspective Transformation: Employed OpenCV's perspective transformation to represent scene depth and perspective, allowing measurement of player movement in meters rather than pixels.
• Speed and Distance Calculation: Calculated player speed and distance covered. Technologies and Tools used:
• Programming Languages: Python
• Framework: OpenCv, Sklearn
• Cloud and Storage: AWS Cloud EC2,S3
• Tools: Docker
