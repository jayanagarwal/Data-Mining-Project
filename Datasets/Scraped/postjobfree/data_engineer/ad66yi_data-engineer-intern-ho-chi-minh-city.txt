PERSONAL PROJECTS
SMS SPAM DETECTION
● Developed a sophisticated SMS spam detection system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, achieving a high accuracy rate of 95%. This model was meticulously trained and validated on a rich dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project involved extensive preprocessing of text data, feature engineering, and precise tuning of the LSTM network to differentiate between spam and legitimate messages effectively.
● Project code: https://github.com/khanhphamj/NLP_Spam_Detection TEXT SUMMARIZER
● Designed and developed an English text summarization application, utilizing state-of-the-art language models (LLMs) from the Hugging Face Transformers library. Integrated user management through a MySQL database, ensuring data security and efficient user data handling. The application was containerized using Docker, enhancing portability and scalability.
