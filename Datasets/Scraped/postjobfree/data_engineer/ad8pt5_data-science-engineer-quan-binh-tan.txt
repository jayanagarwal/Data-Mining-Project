PERSONAL PROJECT
● Big data processing: Customer behavior 1
This project analyzes user behavior in using the service during the 30 days of April 2022. The data was processed using Pyspark and then stored in a MySQL database. The data obtained from the ETL process enables us to identify loyal customers and those at risk of churn, determine preferred movie genres, and identify the most popular movie genres. From this, specific strategies can be developed. Github: click here
