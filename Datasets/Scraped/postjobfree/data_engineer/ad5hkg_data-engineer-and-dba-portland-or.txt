PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
I am a highly skilled technical professional with over 15 years of experience, with extensive experience in SQL Server data warehousing, database development, and database administration. I have extensive experience in SQL Server Management Studio and has used Visio for data modeling. On my last position I was responsible for analyzing performance bottlenecks using SSMS and updating procedures to reduce memory requirements. I have analyzed legacy data sources and has found effective ways to combine them into coherent set of business models and data marts, including combining CRM, software licensing and help desk ticketing into management reports. I have experience doing SQL design of legacy and new databases using Visio an ERWin, tracing data lineage of reports to their main sources. I have helped automate on-prem SQL Data Warehouse which improved overall reliability of the system. I’m looking for my next opportunity where I can use my well-rounded SQL skills to add immediate value to an organization.
