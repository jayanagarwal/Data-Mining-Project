EDUCATION:
Masters Computer Science University of North Texas Denton, Texas 2023-2025 GPA: 3.66/4.0
B.Tech Computer Science Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology 2018-2022 GPA: 8.77/10 COMPUTER SCIENCE PROJECTS:
1. Smart Fashion Advisor: HTML, CSS, Python, Django, MySQL Database, Software Architecture, Github.
This project aims to provide personalized fashion suggestions and improve user satisfaction. Development involves:
• Database Management: Using MySQL, the project stores user preferences, outfit recommendations, influencer details, and customer reviews, ensuring efficient data handling.
• Web Development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create an interactive user interface. Django, a Python-based web framework, supports dynamic page development and backend integration.
• Data Analysis: Python is employed to process user preferences, generate outfit suggestions, and analyze feedback. Libraries like Pandas and NumPy assist in data manipulation and analysis.
• Version Control: Git enables collaborative development, tracks code changes, and manages project milestones effectively.
2. Weather Forecast App: React, Javascript, Tailwind CSS, OpenWeatherMap API.
• Developed an app that fetches Weather forecast data like temperature, humidity, real feel, sunrise, sunset, hourly, and 5-day daily forecast.
• Implemented features to display the local time of the current location and provide forecast details for user-specified cities via a text-box input.
• Integrated OpenWeather API endpoints, achieving 90% accuracy in delivering precise forecast information.
3. An Eye for Sightless: Real-Time Object Detection and Voice Alerts for Visually Impaired: Deep Learning, TensorFlow, Pyttsx3.
• Utilized VGG-16 for live object detection, enhancing its precision through training on the COCO dataset.
• Created an intuitive voice notification system utilizing the Google Text-to-Speech API.
• Utilized knowledge extracted from the COCO dataset to fine-tune the model for optimal performance.
4. Store Basket Analysis using Data Mining Techniques: Python, Data Mining.
• Apriori, Eclat, and Fp-growth data mining algorithms were compared and analyzed to yield an optimal algorithm to help stores and e-commerce restock fast-moving goods.
• The Fp-growth algorithm is effective at producing frequent item-sets with minimal processing. 5. Gender Recognition using Voice: PCA, SVM, Machine Learning.
• Principal component analysis using the SVM algorithm was used to identify the Principal Component with a high variance that distinguishes male and female voice modulations.
• On comparison with other algorithms like Random Forest, and Decision Trees, PCA with SVM gave nearly 98% accuracy giving a scope to use it in public domains like hospitality. ACHIEVEMENTS:
• Earned “Best Team Award” from TCS for outstanding contribution to the organization. PUBLICATIONS:
• Published research paper on ‘Store Basket Analysis using Data Mining algorithms’ in IJARESM, June 2022 issue.
CERTIFICATIONS:
• Databricks Lakehouse Fundamentals, June 2024.
