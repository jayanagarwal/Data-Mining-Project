Projects: Coca-Cola BI,INTER Insurance Data Migration Accomplishments: PySpark ETL Development: Spearheaded the design and implementation of PySpark ETL pipelines to extract, transform, and load large volumes of raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.Optimized ETL processes to enhance performance and reduce processing time. Azure Synapse Development:Played a key role in the migration and development of data solutions within the Azure Synapse Analytics platform, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems. Implemented best practices for data warehousing and performance optimization, resulting in a scalable and eﬃcient data processing environment. Cross- functional Collaboration: Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including data scientists, business analysts, and other stakeholders, to understand business requirements and translate them into actionable data solutions.Acted as a bridge between technical and non-technical teams, ensuring a clear understanding of project objectives and alignment with business goals. Responsibilities: ETL Architecture and Implementation:Architected and implemented ETL processes using PySpark, ensuring the eﬃcient extraction, transformation, and loading of data from diverse sources into the data warehouse. Tasks: Data Integration Projects: Using Apache Kafka for real- time data streaming and integration, this distributed architecture and fault-tolerance features in projects with large volumes of data with low latency. I have implemented Kafka producers and consumers in Python using libraries like conﬂuent-kafka for seamless integration with existing systems. Using Apache Spark DataFrame API and Spark SQL for data transformation, manipulation, and aggregation tasks. Additionally, I have developed Spark jobs in Python using PySpark, harnessing its scalability and performance beneﬁts for data integration workﬂows. Using Apache Airﬂow in orchestration complex data pipelines. This technology was used for task scheduling and monitoring features, enable me to automate data integration processes eﬀectively. I have developed custom Airﬂow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) using Python to orchestrate data ingestion, transformation, and loading tasks across various data sources and destinations. Python Data Libraries (Pandas, NumPy) have been used in several of my data integration projects. I have used Pandas for data manipulation tasks, including data cleaning, merging, and reshaping operations. NumPy has been invaluable for numerical computing tasks, especially when dealing with multidimensional arrays and mathematical functions .Database Systems (SQL, SQLAlchemy): Data integration frequently involves interfacing with relational databases. I am proﬁcient in writing SQL queries to extract, transform, and load data from databases into target systems. Additionally, I have utilized SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit, for database abstraction and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tasks, simplifying the integration process and enhancing code maintainability. With projects using Databrikcs tasks as Integration with Data Lakes and Data Warehouses : Integrations between Data Lakes and Data warehouses, was possible to leverage existing data infrastructure investments and perform analytics across disparate data sources without data movement or duplication. In the other hand this technology was used in other projects in data ingestion, transformation, and preparation. With its distributed computing framework based on Apache Spark, Databricks can handle large-scale data processing eﬃciently, making it ideal for building data pipelines and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workﬂows. Finally in few cases I had the experience to ManagedSpark Infrastructure for eliminating the need for organizations to provision, conﬁgure, and manage their own Spark clusters.
