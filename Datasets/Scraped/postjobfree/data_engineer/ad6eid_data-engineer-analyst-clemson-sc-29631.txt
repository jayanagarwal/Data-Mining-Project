• Optimized data pipelines, enhancing automation within existing Informatica workflows, which led to a decrease in 20 percent of the workflow execution time.
• Directed the implementation of PySpark SQL for complex querying and manipulation of extensive datasets con- taining crucial patient data, drug histories, and performance metrics optimized query performance
• Analysed various Machine Learning Algorithms like Naive Bayes, Linear Regression and Decision Trees using Databricks
• Used UNIX scripting to automate the extraction of data from files with various extensions, streamlining the data retrieval process
• Created Interactive Graphical Representations of Data Outputs Using Tableau. Cognizant Technology Solutions, Hyderabad, India: Data Engineer Intern Dec 2019 – Mar 2020
• Designed a Data Mart and made some macros in VBA to perform complex repetitive tasks of comparing multiple cells in Excel files
• Spearheaded a Power BI project, leveraging Azure MS SQL Database and DAX, to create a high-impact dash- board that communicated sales insights to stakeholders. PROJECTS
Netflix’s OTT platform performance
• Transformed raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis in Tableau, focusing on metrics critical for performance analysis and strategic decision-making.
• Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as subscriber growth trends, top-performing content, average watch time and regional content preferences. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Implementation
• Processed GANs to generate synthetic data samples, employing a competition between generator and discrimina- tor networks. Evaluated model performance using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score, with DCGAN achieving superior results among tested architectures.
Guess Words and Escape From Death
• I crafted a modified version of the traditional Hangman game, adding a unique twist where players must prevent a boat from falling into water. I incorporated customizable settings, enabling players to adjust the number of words and guesses per session, with support for up to 16 words and adjustable guess limits. Additionally, I designed an intuitive user interface featuring interactive widgets, such as a raccoon icon that provides hints, enriching the overall gaming experience.
BERT-Based Extractive Question Answering on SQuAD Dataset
• Implemented a BERT-based extractive question answering model on the SQuAD dataset, aiming to identify precise answer spans within textual contexts by leveraging ’bert-base-uncased’. Enhanced model performance through fine-tuning techniques such as learning rate schedulers and doc stride adjustments. Evaluated accuracy using the Word Error Rate (WER) metric, demonstrating significant improvements in understanding and processing complex query-context pairs.
Library Management System
• Modernised a library web application using MERN Stack and simplified search engine optimization (SEO) tech- niques that improved its page ranking.
