Software Engineer Seattle, Washington
• Revised existing architecture and redesigned the microservices architecture (RESTful API) to create the kenisis video streams and validating the device using IOT core, improving API response time by 15% reducing the cost by 10% .
• Architected a microservices-based solution for device registration and provisioning across various stages of installation. Utilized AWS IoT Core and AWS IoT Devices to streamline the process. Enhanced scalability and eﬃciency while ensuring seamless provision of speciﬁc conﬁgurations.
• Collaborated with a cross-functional team of developers in implementing a new infrastructure using AWS CDK, resulting in a 10% increase in time eﬃciency.
• Contributed to the CI/CD pipeline for integrations, unit tests, and other validations utilizing AWS Pipeline.
• Formulated and regulated web applications and services to display real time information about registration feeds and other details to support 20 thousand devices per customer.
• Developed a RESTful API to facilitate eﬃcient injection and retrieval of raw data into OpenSearch. Leveraged Kinesis Data Streams for bulk data ingestion, signiﬁcantly reducing API calls and supporting throughput of up to 5000 transactions per second (TPS). Ensured optimal performance and scalability for data processing workﬂows.
• Technologies: Django, OpenSearch, MVC, Rust, python, DynamoDB, MVC, Kenisis data stream, kenisis video stream, IOT core, AWS IAM, Lambda, Rest, API Gateway, AWS CDK, Model–view–controller, AWS IoT Devices, smithy model, AWS pipeline, SQL.

Python Developer Pune
• Engineered a bill generation feature from call logs using shell scripting, resulting in a 5% reduction in server stress and a 10% improvement in response time.
• Implemented CI/CD pipelines using AKS for automating software delivery, deployment, and scaling, health checks for seamless deployment.
• Technologies: Python, Docker, Kubernetes, Git lab, shell scripting, PostgreSQL, Angular, HTML5, CSS3, Django. Pye Technologies Oct 2019 - Dec 2020
Python Developer(AI/ML) Nagpur
• Generated reports and dashboards to give insights from raw data analysis and actionable insights to the client.
• Developed a robust data model to represent raw data, customers, and invoices, ensuring eﬃcient storage and retrieval of information.
• Implemented CI/CD pipelines with Git for version management, Jenkins for automation, and Kubernetes for orchestration. Created and maintained shell scripts for system administration.
• Developed a machine learning model to forecast the health status of factory equipment using raw data. Predictive analytics methods were used to improve plans for equipment maintenance and maximize operational eﬀectiveness.
• Technologies: Python, Docker, Kubernetes, Git lab, shell scripting, PostgreSQL, Angular, HTML5, CSS3, Django, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MongoDB, scikit-learn.
Projects
• Finance Management : React.js is used to create an intuitive and responsive interface that gives users the ability to track and organize their spending to eﬀectively manage their ﬁnances. I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle requests and carry out business logic. The backend database used for smooth data store and retrieval was MongoDB.
• Image Classiﬁcation using Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning : Created an image classiﬁer using a deep neural network model using Pytorch that can classify images of diﬀerent categories on the CIFAR-10 Dataset. The model is established on top of pre-trained ResNet-18 and the parameters are ﬁne tuned to produce the ﬁnal CNN model.
