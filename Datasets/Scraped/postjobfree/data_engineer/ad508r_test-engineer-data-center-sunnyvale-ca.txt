Currently I am working on the FLEX Ltd, Test Engineer IV and handling three different projects about
the Microsoft HoloLens AR (IVAS), Cruise (LiDAR) and PDC (Power Distribution Cabinet for Data Center, Amazon). For Laser Experience, Build and assembly high power Pulse laser (including SHG, CAP, OPA, soliton process), Seed laser (Femtosecond pulse laser (model lock laser)) and pulse Amplify. On the Optical Passive Components, design and lead all fusing processes for different customer requests
(Coupler, WDM, Optical Fiber combiner, Amplifies). I have very good fiber laser skill, strong technology background and like to learn new knowledge and love to join a team. Special Project:
HoloLens project for Microsoft (sonic): Build and installer automatic Testing equipment and tester (optical and electrical). Calibration and maintenance tester and equipment. Support manufacturing operations. Introduce test processes, monitor functional test yield, and take corrective actions and cost reductions. Hight temperature fusing process: Created and developed a new process, optimizing current processes based on test results. Finding checkpoint and data analysis. Improve product quality and lifetime (fit).
Optical fiber combiner: fiber selection and process design. Specification and production qualification. Costs down products.
Low loss fiber fusing process for different type fiber (Mode field adapters): new production created, the new process improved, and quality test. Build QA system (work with software eng. and Quality leader): IQC, IPQC, OQA, and Reliability. DCC Datacenter and Database. SPC control and Daily report. Fiber Laser system:
Femtosecond pulse laser (model lock laser): Chirped pulse amplification laser (CPA), 20 to 40 GHz picosecond fiber laser, Second-harmonic generation process Laser (PPLn and BBO crystal), nonlinear optics.
High power nanosecond laser (10~ 20 ns pulse seed laser): 3, 10, and 50 W pulse laser system
(for diamond marking and saw).
Fiber Laser Integration and Process: System integration and optimization, improve manufacturing cycle time, and flow layout, working installation and procedure. Optical Passive Components:
Manufacture and Process development: High power fiber bounder, (1+1) x1 or (2+1) x1 High- Efficiency Combiner, (6+1x1) large core high power combiner, Mode field adapters, Optical Coupler, WDM and DWDM Combiner, and high-reliability coupler. Quality Assurance system and Quality Control:
Manufacturing: Production line layouts, procedure and working instauration, BOM, and cycle time and yield rate.
Process Control: QC checkpoints setup, Database and analysis (statistical process control), setup a quality control system from IQC, IPQC to OQA.
