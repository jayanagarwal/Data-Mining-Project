PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Senior Data Analyst
TEKPROS LLC (February 2024 – Present)
Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to design and implement an ETL pipeline that extracts data from various sources, transforms it into a unified format, and loads it into a central data warehouse. The processed data will then be visualized using Power BI to provide actionable insights into customer data patterns, trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs). This project enables the organization to gain deep insights into customer data patterns, improve decision-making processes, and drive business growth through data-driven strategies. The interactive Power BI dashboards will provide stakeholders with easy access to key metrics and trends, facilitating informed decisions and strategic planning. Responsibilities:
• Served as a technical expert within the development team, actively contributing to the analysis, design, and implementation of business intelligence solutions, ETL processes, and databases essential for supporting diverse systems.
• Extract data from various sources such as on premises SQL server database, APIs, flat files, and cloud-based MySQL database and csv files stored in Azure Blob Storage using SQL queries and Python scripts and ensure data extraction processes are efficient and reliable, capturing all necessary data for analysis.
• Transform raw data into structured formats suitable for analysis using Python libraries like Pandas and SQL. Clean and preprocess data to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
• Design, develop, and maintain ETL pipelines to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading processes using tools such as Apache Airflow and custom Python scripts. Monitor and optimize ETL pipelines for performance, reliability, and scalability.
• Responsible for designing and maintaining database schemas, tables, indexes, and views to support data storage and retrieval using SQL.
• Optimize database performance by tuning SQL queries and indexing strategies.
• Implemented data quality checks and validation procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data.
• Proficient in identifying and resolving database performance issues, specializing in query optimization, index tuning, and resource utilization as part of Performance Tuning and Optimization initiatives.
• Clean and preprocess raw data using Python's Pandas library & SAS data manipulation tools. Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
• Performed data mining tasks such as association rule mining, clustering, or text mining using Python's NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit).
• Developed intricate SQL statements for data fixes, modifications, and reporting, ensuring data validity within target tables.
• Created Power BI reports and dashboards to efficiently visualize data.
• Responsible for converting intricate data sets into visual representations, such as charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards, utilizing Power BI, Microsoft Power Apps & Python's Matplotlib.
• Conduct exploratory data analysis using Python's Pandas, Matplotlib and SAS to gain insights into the dataset.
• Proficiently communicate and present data-driven insights and recommendations to both internal and external stakeholders, actively seeking and integrating feedback as necessary.
• Document analysis workflows, methodologies, and results using version control systems like Git and project management tools like Jira.
