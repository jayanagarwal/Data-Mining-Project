To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this note on behalf of Stephen Hobbs and providing my recommendation for him regarding his performance.

I have known Steve since early in 2021 as he reported directly to me in support of my Application Portfolio Management team. During the time I worked with Steve, I came to appreciate the many skills and values that he embodies. Steve quickly established himself within my team as a person that solved problems and had an ability to establish networks and relationships to promote the success of my department’s initiatives.

I was also very impressed with Steve’s interest in understanding the business, customers, competitors, and what the company was trying to achieve. I believe his sincere curiosity about the business combined with his outstanding technical skills, results orientation, and strong networking skills would make him a great candidate for the role you are hiring for.

Based on our experience together, I can confidently recommend Steve for the role of Senior Business Analyst as well as similar roles that require a similar skillset.

Sincerely,

Brandon Bumeter
