PROJECTS
Tactical Archery Systems: Python, Matlab, Matplotlib Gathered theoretical and experimental data for Tactical Archery Systems in order to test a new prototype crossbow design. The theoretical data was calculated using Hooke’s Law in Python and Matlab. Stress and Strain Graphs for the different materials were created using Matplotlib to show the Linear relationship between them. Dielectrophoresis Analysis: Python, Pandas, Matlab Gathered scientific data for research regarding high frequency dielectrophoresis and its effects on a particle through an electric field.The dielectric-force along with the Clausius-Mossotti Factor was calculated using Matlab and Python. Pandas was used to perform analysis on the data to determine at what frequency changes the particle’s behavior. Apple Cash Flow Analysis: Python, Pandas, Power BI Gathered financial data of Apple for the last ten years and stored the data as a CSV file. Python was used for Data Wrangling and for Predictive Modeling in order to calculate future horizon values. The data was then analyzed using Pandas,and graphs, charts, and slicers were produced using MS Power BI.
CRM Opportunity Analysis: BI and ETL (in prog)
Built operational reports for the Sales Management team to track the sales funnel and identify opportunities and gaps in the current Sales process. Performed ETL using T-SQL on SQL Server. Built Data Model and executive dashboards in Power BI using DAX and Power Query.

Heart Disease Analysis: Python, Sklearn, Azure ML, Power BI (in prog) Aggregated and Analyzed Heart Disease Data for Switzerland and determined what factors had the greatest correlation to the presence of Heart Disease. Python used for Data Wrangling and ETL. Analyzed performance across Logistic Regression, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Random Forests to provide the model with the best precision.
