Passionate game designer with 4 years of indie game development experience. Spent a lot of time prototyping and programming C# in Unity. A little over a year ago I transitioned t Unreal programming with blueprints and C++, so I can have experience in both leading softwares. Love joining conventions and projects, along with watching lectures about the gaming industry to stay up to date and to get more experience. Open to relocation or remote positions.

JANUARY 2021 - DECEMBER 2021, Remote
At this indie studio I worked on several projects, my top favorite was 2 Foxes. Worked on blocking out levels and ﬁlling levels. Programed aesthetics into the game with C# and a couple of animations with some quick prop modeling. Added moving clouds in the background and in-camera view making it feel more lively, along with adding in moving birds, and some background sounds for water, wind, and birds chirps. The next project was Flip which I spent time level designing and adding props to the level, along with enemies and collectibles. The ﬁnal project I worked on was Scrapbots, in this project I mainly worked on UI, programming features in C#, and animations for enemies and the player.
Lionbridge / Game Tester - Contract Position
JUNE 2020 - NOVEMBER 2020, Redmond, WA
Tested compatibility for hundreds of games on the Xbox series S and X. While testing the games, I encountered issues with UI, movement, controls, crashes, etc. I would then write up a bug report and send it off to be reviewed. After it was reviewed by a supervisor it was then sent off to the developers.
