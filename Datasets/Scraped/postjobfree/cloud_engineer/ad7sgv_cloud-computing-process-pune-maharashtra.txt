Automated Cloud Infrastructure and CI/CD Pipeline Setup Designed and implemented an automated infrastructure setup for IntelliKart to transition from on- premises to AWS Cloud. The goal was to achieve high availability, scalability, and reliability for their web application, incorporating modern DevOps practices. Infrastructure Provisioning:
Created a Terraform Master instance and used Terraform to provision a VPC, subnet, and three EC2 instances (Jenkins Master, Kubernetes Master, Kubernetes Slave) in AWS. Configuration Management:
Automated the installation and configuration of Jenkins, Kubernetes, and Docker using Ansible. Configured Jenkins to manage Kubernetes deployments effectively and integrated the setup for continuous integration and deployment.
CI/CD Pipeline:
Forked and containerized a static website repository using Docker. Created and configured a Jenkinsfile for automated build, push, and deployment processes. Deployed Kubernetes manifests for scaling and managing the application, ensuring seamless updates and deployments.
