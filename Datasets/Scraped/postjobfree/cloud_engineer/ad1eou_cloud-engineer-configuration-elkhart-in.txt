Client: Signet Jewelers, Akron, OH Jan 2023– Sep 2023
Role: DevOps Engineer / Cloud Engineer

Responsibilities:
Create AWS Cloud Formation templates that can be customized to deploy Java web applications and database templates with ease by including provisions for VPC, subnets, and NAT.
By utilizing Cloud Formation to implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices and version controlling infrastructure changes with Git, development teams were able to improve visibility, collaboration, and agility in their workflow.
Worked alongside development teams to construct and administer Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts utilizing Git source code management tools, guaranteeing version control and consistency throughout different environments.
Automated deployment pipelines and streamlined DevOps procedures using Python.
Produced and sustained documentation for Maven build scripts, and enhanced Maven build performance by managing plug-in dependencies and configuring plug-in execution.
Devised and executed a CI/CD pipeline through Jenkins utilizing Groovy and AWS Code Pipeline, streamlining the build, testing, and deployment process for multiple applications across various environments.
Constructed and sustained Docker container clusters through Kubernetes, Linux, Bash, Git, and Docker on AWS. Employed Kubernetes and Docker as the runtime environment for the CI/CD system to develop and automate testing.
Strong understanding of containerization concepts, including container image creation, container networking, and container lifecycle management, to enable efficient and scalable deployment of applications.
Experience in designing and implementing containerized architectures using Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes, to achieve high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.
Designed Terraform configurations to enable infrastructure scaling and auto-scaling in response to varying workloads and demands.
Integrated Terraform with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate resource provisioning and updates.
Used Cloud Watch to monitor AWS resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and Lambda functions for performance and availability, and to set up alarms to notify the team of any issues.
