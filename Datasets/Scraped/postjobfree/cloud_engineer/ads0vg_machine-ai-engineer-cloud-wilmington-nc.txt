- Azure Cloud Migration Project:
. Projects Overview : We migrated On-prem entire AI/ML Environment/Platforms/Components into Azure Clouds via terraform and manual deployment. On-prem environment : VMs(Edge Nodes), Hadoop/Spark/Yarn Clusters echo systems(Hortonworks), MySql/MSSQL databases, Elasticsearch/Kibana/Logstash, all python codes into Databricks Notebooks
. Roles : As a lead Architect/Engineer, I created Azure Cloud Topology, build All resources in PROD and NPRD subscriptions including the resources below:
. Implemented Resources

Implement AI/ML Deployment Process via Jenkins: Deploy new release codes(python) for the AI/ML Pipeline(Training and Inference Pipeline) from Git Repository including from ingestion to model build, deploy all data ingested as data-source, rerun all pipeline jobs by registering cron jobs, execute pipeline jobs and build model, validate models and deploy models(pickles, parquets) to Rest API for inference pipeline
. Deploy AI/ML via MLFlow/MLOps in Databricks and H2O : Using MLFlow, model is trained and registered as Experiments in Databricks Machine Learning Frameworks, Validate ML Models using SHAP analysis, Generate deployment projects in H2O and deploy models as model serving api(Kubernates). By using Model Serving Endpoints provided by H2O, we simplified Inference deployment process and be able to manage model versions in Databricks.
