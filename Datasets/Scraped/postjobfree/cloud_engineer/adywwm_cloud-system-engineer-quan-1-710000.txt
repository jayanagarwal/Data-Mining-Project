I am a person who doesn't mind difficulties, when i have a problem, I will try all my best to solve them. I enjoy the feeling of rushing to overcome difficulties. For me, a day without progress is a boring day. Therefore, I look forward to having the opportunity to learn from the brothers and sisters in the company to accumulate professional knowledge. From there, develop into Solution Architect within 3-4 years.
