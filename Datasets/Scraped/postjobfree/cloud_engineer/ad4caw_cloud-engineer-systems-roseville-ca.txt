Jesse A. Sackman
Azure/AWS Cloud Engineer

To whom it may concern,

You see many applications, I’ll keep this brief.

I’ve always had a curious mind and have had a colorful, successful career as a result. I’ve achieved as a programmer, a teacher, a salesperson, a consultant, a systems engineer and, for the past eight years, a Cloud engineer.

Past managers’ reviews cite my reliability, positive energy, willingness to jump on any challenge, that I improve cohesiveness of teams I join, and that I often find creative solutions to problems.

I thrive on challenging work in supportive environments with smart and creative people.

Thank you very much for your time and attention. I hope we will speak soon.

Career Highlights

Certifications and Education
I developed a broad re-architecture proposal, approved to be implemented in Q3 of 2024.

Years ago Azure had been introduced improperly. No advance design work or documentation had been done. Departments then created their work ad hoc, leaving a disjointed mess.

The plan reorganizes networking, sets policies, centralizes storage, logging and key management and set action plans for live transition of each resource group.

I managed my sole practitioner consulting company to bill $250,000+ annually.

I serviced business of all stripe but some well-recognized ones included Air New Zealand, Paramount Studios, Disney, Rubbermaid, the Office of Ronald Reagan, Premiere Radio Networks, All Nippon Airways, and David Geffen Records.

I provided custom programming services, such as these examples:

oA seating management app for Dick Clark Productions, used for the American Music Awards/Country Music Awards, delivered in just two weeks and $9,000 under budget.

oA full featured IMDB-like application developed in one month for an MGM Studios affiliate.

oA record-sales tracking system of ASCAP disbursements for a boutique record label, Private Music.
