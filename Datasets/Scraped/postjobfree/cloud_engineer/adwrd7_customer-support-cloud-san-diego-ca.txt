Designed and built a custom content management system for a client using Ruby on Rails. This involved creating a flexible data model, implementing user authentication and authorization, and integrating with third-party APIs.
I have worked on a variety of projects involving cloud infrastructure, hybrid deployments, and automation. Here are some highlights of my job experience. Designed and implemented hybrid cloud solutions for clients, using Azure and other cloud technologies to seamlessly integrate on-premises infrastructure with cloud services. This involved configuring and optimizing virtual networks, implementing VPN and ExpressRoute connectivity, and ensuring secure communication between the hybrid components. Developed automation scripts and tools for deploying and managing cloud resources, using technologies such as PowerShell, Azure CLI, and Terraform. I was responsible for ensuring that the deployment and management processes were consistent, repeatable, and efficient. Provided technical guidance and support to clients, helping them to identify and implement best practices for hybrid cloud infrastructure. I also provided training and mentorship to junior engineers on the team, helping them to develop their technical skills and knowledge. Contributed to the development of hybrid cloud solutions for internal projects, working with cross-functional teams to define requirements and ensure successful implementation. I worked closely with developers, QA engineers, and project managers to ensure that the hybrid components met the needs of the project.

As a software engineer at Pubix company, I was responsible for designing and implementing a real-time data processing system for the client. The system needed to handle a high volume of data streaming from various sources and make it available for analysis and reporting in near real-time. After researching various technologies, we decided to use Apache Kafka as the backbone of our system. One particular project that I worked on was a dashboard for the client's marketing team to track the performance of their social media campaigns. I used Kafka to ingest data from various social media APIs, including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. We then transformed and enriched the data using Kafka Streams before storing it in a PostgreSQL database. To ensure the data was always up-to-date, I implemented a Kafka Connect connector to continuously poll the social media APIs for new data. I also used Kafka's partitioning and replication features to ensure fault tolerance and high availability. Overall, using Kafka allowed us to build a scalable and reliable system that could handle large volumes of data and provide near real-time insights to my client's marketing team.

As a Cloud Solutions Architect at Google, I was responsible for designing and implementing cloud solutions using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). My job involved working closely with clients to understand their business needs and developing customized solutions that met their requirements. One of the projects I worked on involved migrating a client's on-premises infrastructure to GCP. The client was experiencing performance issues with their existing infrastructure and wanted to move to a more scalable and cost efficient solution. To start, I conducted a thorough assessment of their current infrastructure and identified areas where GCP could provide significant improvements. Based on my assessment, I designed a solution that involved moving their workloads to GCP's compute engine and leveraging GCP's load balancing capabilities to distribute traffic across multiple instances. I also recommended using GCP's managed services such as Cloud SQL for their database needs and Cloud Storage for their file storage needs. This allowed the client to reduce their infrastructure costs and efficient solution. To accomplish this, I first conducted a thorough analysis of the client's existing infrastructure and identified areas that could be improved through migration to GCP. I then designed a customized solution that included the use of GCP services such as Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL. During the implementation phase, I worked closely with the client's IT team to ensure a smooth migration process. This involved setting up the necessary infrastructure in GCP, configuring the network and security settings, and migrating efficient solution. I conducted a thorough analysis of their existing infrastructure and identified the key areas that needed improvement. Based on my analysis, I designed a cloud solution using GCP that addressed the client's performance issues and provided them with a more scalable and cost-effective solution. I implemented a combination of GCP services such as Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL to build a highly available and fault-tolerant infrastructure.

I encountered an issue where some of the containers were not able to connect to the external resources due to incorrect configurations. This led to downtime and affected the user experience. I implemented a solution that involved using AWS System Manager Parameter Store to store the configuration settings for the containers. I created a custom Docker image that would retrieve the configuration settings from the Parameter Store during the container start-up process. To ensure the security of the configuration settings, I used AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to grant permissions to the ECS task definitions to access the Parameter Store. I also encrypted the configuration settings using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for additional security. After implementing this solution, the containers were able to retrieve the correct configuration settings during the start-up process, which eliminated the connectivity issues. The users were able to access the application without any downtime or interruptions, resulting in a positive user experience.
