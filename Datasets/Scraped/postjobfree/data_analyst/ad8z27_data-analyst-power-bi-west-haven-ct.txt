PROJECTS
COVID-19 Chest X-ray Image Classification (Python, PyTorch, CNN) Developed a deep learning model using Python, PyTorch, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like AlexNet and ResNet18 to classify chest X-ray images into normal, COVID-19, and viral pneumonia categories. Implemented data preprocessing and image augmentation techniques to improve model robustness and generalization. Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, achieving over 95% accuracy in COVID-19 detection. This project demonstrates the potential to provide healthcare professionals with a reliable and efficient preliminary diagnostic tool for identifying COVID-19 and other viral infections. Sales Forecasting Using ARIMA (Python, Time-Series Analysis, Statsmodels) Developed a sales forecasting model using the ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) approach to predict future sales trends based on historical data. Leveraged Python and its statistical libraries, such as pandas and statsmodels, to preprocess and analyze time-series data. Implemented the ARIMA model to identify patterns, seasonality, and trends in sales, enabling accurate forecasting. Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to ensure reliability. The project provides valuable insights for making data-driven decisions to optimize inventory management and improve sales strategies. School Dropout Analysis (PowerBI,Data Analysis, EDA, Machine Learning) Conducted an in-depth analysis to identify key factors contributing to student dropouts, focusing on socioeconomic status, attendance patterns, and parental involvement. Utilized data analysis techniques and machine learning models to uncover actionable insights aimed at improving student retention rates. Developed strategies for early intervention and increased parental engagement to help schools reduce dropout rates and support at-risk students. PUBLICATIONS
