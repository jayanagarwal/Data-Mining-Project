Business Systems Analyst
Contracted to perform in business systems analyst role to collect and document requirements for several new and existing/in progress applications, a service advocate dashboard application, a file and job inventory management application and incidental requests for maintenance of existing processes.

The file and job inventory management application is a project already underway. This applications objective was to identify and inventory incoming transaction files and automated jobs so that responsible managers and teams are kept informed as to file activity and adherence to service level agreements and controls. When files or jobs do not conform to service level agreements alerts are distributed to responsible managers and teams alerting them to the need to manual intervention. In some cases controls and control reports required manual intervention.

Requests for maintenance to exiting processes were general things like accumulating and documenting requirements for incidental tasks such as changing attribute formats due to timestamp changes or other issues.
