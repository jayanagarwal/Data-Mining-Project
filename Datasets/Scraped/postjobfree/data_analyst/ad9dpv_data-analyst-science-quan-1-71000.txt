PROJECT
Diabetes Prediction with PySpark Jul 2024 - Sep 2024 member: 1
Description:
- Predictive methods based on data analysis can provide valuable information about disease risk, thereby helping medical professionals and patients to take timely interventions to prevent or reduce the progression of the disease.
- Adopting a data science approach involves the following steps: The first is data collection and preprocessing, which includes the cleaning, normalization, and processing of missing data. Next, we perform data discovery analysis (EDA) to better understand the characteristics and relationships in the data through visualization and statistical techniques. Then, build and train machine learning models using PySpark, including algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, and apply model evaluation techniques to compare performance.
