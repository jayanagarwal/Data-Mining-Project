PROFILE
I am a final student (available for full-time position) of Business Administration at the University of Finance and Marketing (UFM). Although I am an Economics student, I have a passion for the IT industry. I am a person of integrity, loyalty, and trust in people. I have a good attitude for teamwork, and I am always willing to learn and collaborate with others.
With hands-on experience in Data Analytics, complemented by proficiency in SQL, Python, and Power BI, I have successfully completed several projects showcased on my GitHub. I am now eager to apply my skills as a Data Analyst Intern, where I can contribute to data-driven decision-making and innovation.
