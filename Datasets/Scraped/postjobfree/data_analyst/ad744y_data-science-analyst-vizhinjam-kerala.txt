OpenCV, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Keras, and Tkinter were among the sophisticated Python libraries utilised.
Resulting in a thorough comprehension of computer vision methods. Project Assistant / CSIR-NIIST
January 2016 – September 2016 June 2022 – May 2023
The primary goal of the "Crosstalk between HER receptor and STAT" study was to computationally model and simulate the pathways involved in EGFR signalling in order to fully investigate how these pathways work in the HME cell line.
The connection between the HER receptor and STAT has been well studied.
The STAT3 signalling pathway was coded in C++, and the profiles were plotted using the R interface.
