PYTHON FOR MACHINE LEARNING Machine Learning
• Analyzed and preprocessed two datasets, Diabetes and Compas, focusing on both training and testing phases. For each dataset, trained various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes, MLP, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, XGBoost, AdaBoost and SGD Classifier. Applied techniques such as GridSearchCV and cross-validation to optimize model performance. Additionally, utilized StandardScaler, OrdinalEncoder, and RobustScaler to enhance data preparation and model accuracy.
• Using: Python (Google Colab, Kaggle, Jupyter Notebook)
• My responsibilities:
Data preprocessing, encoding, feature engineering, exception handling, visualization and reporting.
Model training, fine-tuning and experimentation with normalization techniques.
