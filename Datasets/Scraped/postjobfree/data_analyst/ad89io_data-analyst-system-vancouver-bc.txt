ABOUT ME
I grew up as a twin on a farm where I learned three things: Teamwork is important, what a hard day’s work is, and that automating tasks saves time. I went to university to learn how to program, connect systems together, and troubleshoot. I enjoy platforms like Azure and AWS to speed up deployment. I have completed the Data Analytics Essentials course by IBM in Sep 2022.

I enjoy making videos to save people time (2,879,829,164 seconds) and then a data analysis on how much time was saved through engagement. I use it as an excuse to automate tasks in Python, Selenium, PowerShell, SQL, and Excel.
