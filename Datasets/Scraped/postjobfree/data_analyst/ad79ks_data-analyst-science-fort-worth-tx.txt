Project Overview: Enhancing Credit Loss Predictions for CECL Compliance
Background
A financial institution was grappling with an increasing rate of loan defaults and declining revenues from unrecoverable loans. This situation was exacerbated by missing customer information and potential outliers in customer deposit, share balances, and loan balances. These challenges not only compromised the financial health of the institution but also raised compliance concerns with the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) standards.
Objective
The primary goal was to harness advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to enhance the precision of customer default predictions. This project was pivotal in aligning the institution's practices with CECL requirements, which demand an upfront acknowledgment of expected credit losses over the life of financial instruments.
Responsibilities
- Feature Engineering: Conducted a thorough analysis of customer data to identify and engineer pertinent features that could significantly influence the prediction of customer defaults. This task involved managing missing information, rectifying outliers, and generating new variables to offer deeper insights into customer behavior.
- Model Development:Spearheaded the development and deployment of machine learning models aimed at predicting the likelihood of customer defaults. This phase prominently featured the use of XGBoost, an advanced ensemble technique known for its effectiveness in handling complex datasets and improving predictive accuracy, alongside logistic regression for its interpretability. The choice of XGBoost was driven by its superior performance in capturing non-linear relationships and its robustness against overfitting, making it a critical component in our modeling strategy.
Impact
The implementation of this project markedly improved the financial institution's ability to accurately predict customer defaults, leading to better-informed loan issuance decisions and enhanced compliance with CECL standards. The insights derived from the modeling efforts, particularly those powered by XGBoost, also guided strategic decisions regarding customer engagement and risk management, fostering a stronger framework for managing credit loss expectations.
