Work Experience:
Senior Research Statistician
Case Western Reserve University
4/2023 - Present
Duties, Accomplishments and Related Skills:
As the senior member of the Population Health and Outcomes Research team, I worked independently to provide consultation and guidance for clinicians and other investigators. I assumed supervisory duties delegated by the Principal Investigator and was fully responsible for formulating study objectives, designing research protocols, and writing proposals. I oversaw the day-to-day operation of five clinical projects and the implementation of goals across multidisciplinary and multi-institutional international teams, which involved tracking all aspects of projects, identifying needs, and facilitating the execution of solutions. I developed standard protocols to evaluate findings and surveys related to public health and policy. Additionally, I mentored new team members and guided junior researchers on techniques, statistical methods, and procedures. I generated reports for public health and policy, providing valuable insights and recommendations based on research findings. Furthermore, I authored research findings for publications, papers, meeting presentations, grants, and other documentation.
Health Science Research Analyst/Statistician
Case Western Reserve University
8/2018 - 3/2023
Duties, Accomplishments and Related Skills:
At the Population Health and Outcome Research Core of the university, I assumed a leadership role in study design, data collection, analysis, and reporting. I provided statistical support for research projects across various departments within the School of Medicine, as well as partner institutes like the Cleveland Clinic and MetroHealth Hospitals. Data sources encompassed the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Medicaid and Medicare data, Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey, Cancer registry data (e.g., Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER), Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System (OCISS), U.S. Census data, Health Retirement Study, and other relevant studies.
During this period, I completed over 30 clinical research projects, exploring topics such as the opioid epidemic, cancer prevalence in HIV patients, and outcomes of various cardiovascular and orthopedic surgeries. I collaborated closely with team members from multiple academic and health institutions in Ohio, participating in conference calls with clinicians across different specialties and regions for various studies. I developed study algorithms and flowcharts for each research project and successfully secured five-year funding with two groups from our partner institute. Additionally, I played an integral role in monitoring study quality assurance and maintaining effective communication with investigators. As a Biostatistician, I specialized in data management through programming SAS codes, developing macros, and processing data with R packages for complex statistical methods and machine learning. I utilized advanced Excel and Tableau for data visualization and interpreted results for investigators. Furthermore, I meticulously documented all steps involved in preparing different versions of the analytic file, generated data dictionaries, and curated archival datasets for future use by investigators.
One of my notable achievements was the development of a new statistical model for analyzing disease prevalence, leading to the discovery of high cancer prevalence among men living with HIV. This work was featured on Science Daily News
(https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/22-031*******.htm). Research Associate
Case Western Reserve University
8/2008 - 7/2018
Duties, Accomplishments and Related Skills:
At the Cardiovascular Research Institute of the university, I had the privilege of working under the mentorship of Dr. Mukesh Jain, an internationally renowned physician-scientist. I established various genetic animal models of cardiovascular diseases, leading to fundamental discoveries in the field. During this period, I played a key role in the functioning of one of the nation's top-funded laboratories. I initiated, managed, and executed goal- oriented projects that laid the groundwork for three NIH grants totaling $3,000,000. Thriving within a fast-paced collaborative environment, I mentored three graduate students and five undergraduates, and published more than 20 research articles. Notable findings from these publications include the discovery of a key genetic factor influencing blood vessel health (First author, 2012, Journal of Clinical Research: PMID: 23160196, Journal of Clinical Research Insights, co-first author, 2017:PMID: 28239661), and the identification of a conserved pathway controlling aging (Nature Communications, 2017, co-first author, PMID: 29030550). Through this experience, my interest in translational science grew, paving the way for my next professional goal. Research Fellow
Case Western Reserve University
8/2005 - 7/2008
Duties, Accomplishments and Related Skills:
At the Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences of the university, I focused on the study of genetic control of colorectal cancer. Under the mentorship of geneticist Dr. Guangbin Luo, I developed strong skills in molecular biology and computational biology. The findings from this work were highlighted in the discovery of a key protein involved in DNA replication and repair
(First author, International Journal of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2010: PMID: 21968968).
Research Fellow
Mayo Clinic
7/2004 - 7/2005
Duties, Accomplishments and Related Skills:
I immigrated to the United States and worked as a research fellow at Mayo Clinic. I studied the genetic control of colorectal cancer under the mentorship of geneticist Dr. Wanguo Liu. During this time, I acquired excellent skills in molecular genetics. Our research findings were featured in a scientific publication (Co-first author, PLOS, 2009: PMID: 19956716). Education:
