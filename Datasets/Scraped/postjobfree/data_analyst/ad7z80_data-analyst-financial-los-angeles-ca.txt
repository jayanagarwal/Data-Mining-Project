As a Data Analyst / Systems, I have over 25 years of experience as a Data Analyst, MS Excel Developer, MS Access Developer, SQL Developer, & Financial Analyst. I have combined my accounting and financial experience with desktop applications development. My advanced financial analyst skills include modeling, forecasting, and reporting. I develop Microsoft Office applications using the VBA Visual Basic language.

My advanced financial skills include creating complex models with many variables. I develop forecasting models using regression, smoothing, and breakeven analysis. These methods were used for sales forecasting, budgeting, and new product introduction analysis. I develop financial reports for fixed and variable annuities.

MS Excel, Access, Word, SQL Server, and other office applications can be developed as standalone programs or in combinations. For example, an Excel workbook program with sophisticated modeling and pivot tables can be the front end for an Access database. These applications can be either the controller or server. MS Access can be the reporting function while querying directly from an Excel workbook that processes a text download.
MS Word can be the front end for reporting or mailing labels using an Access database or Excel table.

I am looking for an opportunity where I can use my advanced skills and wear multiple hats if needed. My financial background combined with computer skills provides effective custom solutions for financial or statistical reporting programs.
