Projects
Air Pollution Over Time
https://github.com/smoot888/Project3
Integrated public air pollution API data with a CSV of the pollutant types to study how pollution has changed over last 20 years in major US cities.
Worked within a team of four using GitHub.
Used SQLite to host the pollution data.
Used SQL-Alchemy to host the data server within python.
Used Dash-app to create a dropdown menu display of line graphs for every major city for each pollutant and pollutants overall. Added a linear regression line with r and p-values for each.
Performed t-tests with scipy-stats for each pollutant iterating over each state to determine significant change over time.
Evaluated which cities and states improved the most in air quality and which worsened most, by pollutant and overall.

Heart Disease Prediction Data Modeling
https://github.com/nickbrannum02/Project-4
Worked within a team of four through GitHub.
Data modeling to determine risk of heart disease from a variety of factors.
Data training, model fitting, and model evaluation through scikit-learn, sk-learn, and TensorFlow.
Data modeled with random forest, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random over-sampling, XG Boost, and neural network.
Evaluated Machine Learning models with confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC curve.
Created user input using java, html, and jsonify to allow a user to answer a questionnaire and give an output of either high or low heart disease risk based on the model.
