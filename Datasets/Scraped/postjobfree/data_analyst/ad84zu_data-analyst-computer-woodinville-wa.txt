Reprocess publicly available ProteomeXchange Mass Spec proteomics large scale data for the resource library PeptideAtlas.org using open source TransProteomePipeline software on Arabidopsis and Maize organisms. Added new pipelines, slurm queue interfaces, modified existing pipelines, method qualification, validation, implemented bash scripts, c and python programs and designed workflows for automation of analysis using slurm queues resulting in six peer reviewed publications. Delivered preliminary data for reports and finalized data summaries in a timely manner for project milestones. Created data visualizations using Python for publications, created and delivered quarterly one hour power point presentations for progress reports to scientific audiences. Presented posters and talks at proteomics symposium, Cascadia Proteomics Symposium. Utilizing existing genomic databases, data mined and incorporated RNA edits into proteomic search databases, identifying RNA edits in protein sequences. Peptide and protein sequences with their RNA edits are listed in the PeptideAtlas, a publicly available resource at PeptideAtlas.org for Maize and Arabidopsis protein communities. Read and extracted biometrics data from 500+ papers to determine eligibility for inclusion into reprocess large scale data sets. Presented hour long quarterly updates to scientific audiences, presented poster and gave short talk at Seattle’s 2023 Cascadia Proteomics Symposium.

2012-2018 – Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Livermore, California
Designed and implemented algorithms for incorporating variants in protein databases from genomic databases. Searched for variants from different ethnic populations in Mass Spec data. At LLNL we examined the hair proteins of 120 individuals and we obtained NGS genotypes (NGS Illumina) for these individuals. Responsible for collection of all possible hair variants (tissue specific for hair and related proteins) from the Broad MIT database and integrating these variants into a protein search database. This database was used for mapping the mass spectrometry data to peptides found in the samples. The objective of the project was to determine if any variant could be found in hair proteins and if these variants could be used to determine ethnic or identifying information from hair shaft samples. Developed the pipelines for analyzing the mass spectrometry data sets using the search engines Comet, MSGS and XTandem. Created scripts and pipelines to merge these results for data validation. Developed algorithms to determine which peptides contained variants. Implemented scripts to search results to determine which samples contained variants.

1992-2012 – Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah
Created one of a kind software to analyze complex and extended human pedigrees. Engineered visualizations for genotype + phenotype data. Invented haplotype and breakpoint chromosome visualization algorithms. NGS data was collected on the original 10 sib families, known as the CEPH families. Curated genotypes from Illumina, creating breakpoint maps and haplotype routines to create visualizations of inherited segments of chromosomes from grandparents to grandchildren. Graphically reduced the large 2G datasets per person, to one graphic sheet per 10 sib family (8-20 persons) showing the inheritance patterns as they varied from sibling to sibling. Along with the breakpoint maps, small area haplotyping was performed, this process uncovered mis-inheritances which were examined to determine if the base/allele calls were correct, or if a spontaneous mutation could have occurred.

Oracle DBA for UGRP human pedigree data, phenotype, SNPs, RFLPs. Designed and developed programs to analyze SNP data looking for shared regions, haplotypes and breakpoints. A genetics project was funded to look at CEPH families searching for non-disease genes. A large self–report questionnaire, along with fasting blood draw, and 10 other stations manned by physician researchers to collect measurements from three generation family groups (grandparent, parent and children) participants. Some of the measurements collected were hearing exams, vision/eye exams, fully body scan biometrics, 62 blood metrics, psychology measurements, lifestyle questionnaires, skin exams, lung/heart/pulmonary health exams etc. Designed the database to enter/store and retrieve these measurements keeping in mind HIPPA requirements, multiple secure access points by various medical schools and data entry and double checking protocols. Implemented software for retrieval of this data as well as integrating phenotype and genotype pipelines for analysis protocols. The data analysis involved circular steps of normalization, analysis, interpretation, possible reformatting of analysis parameters based on initial results and then re-evaluation. Visualization, validation and quantification for various types of data examined. Some simple graphics provided by R, or excel could be used, and sometimes a more complex output visualization was required. Pascal and C code were used to create postscript files for a customized visualization.

Database manager and data entry designer for the clinical genetic database for the University of Utah medical center physician researchers. There were 72 different diseases studied using this comprehensive clinical Sybase database which was structured to provide security and privacy between research entities and physician researchers.

Planned and developed user interface for data entry, Autism and Tourette research centers. Performed genetic linkage analysis using SAS, linkage, PAP, solar, loki, fastlink on multiple psychiatric disorders.

Designed and implemented tools and interfaces for genetic mapping, maps used for the Human Genome Project. Created framework maps for the HapMap project using data originating from the lab of Dr. Ray White at the University of Utah, Human Genetics Department a key group in the HapMap project. Collaborated with geneticists to create automated pipelines for determining framework maps using RFLP and STR datasets. We utilized LINKAGE analysis, processing data through RFLP and STR frameworks. The algorithm started with small numbers of markers and automatically gradually filled in large gaps with new markers. Each time a marker was added to the map, existing physical mapping information, if available, was compared for accuracy.

Managed and mentored a team of programmers to develop an automated genotyping collection system from digitized florescent images. Pipeline entailed image capture, manipulation, analysis, database interface, database design, database implementation and graphical user interface as well as backup and storage management for a large volume of digitized images. For the NIH National Heart Study, I managed a team of software developers and engineers that developed an automated multiplex genotyping system based on repeated hybridizations of markers to a DNA digest on filter paper. This system involved a pipeline starting with image capture, automated image scoring, automated data storage in an Oracle relational database, error calling, user interface, backup/storage of data and extraction of genotypes for several diseases for linkage analysis of both phenotype and genotype in both familial data as well as for GWAS data analysis. The team was successful in creating working high throughput automated genotyping resulting in multiple significant publications in peer review journals.

Envisioned and implemented algorithms for automated linkage genetic analysis.

1986-1992 – Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah
Developed reports and debugged algorithms for the first widely used genetic analysis package (LINKAGE). Implemented many of the original LINKAGE output routines to visualize the result of each type of analysis, MLINK, ILINK, CILINK and LINKMAP. These routines were written for Dr. Jean-Marc Lalouel and Dr. Marc Lathrop at the University of Utah, Department of Human Genetics.
