Project III: Analyzing Factors Affecting Property Prices in Real Estate Market
Duration: January 2023 – May 2023
University: University Of North Texas
Location: Denton, TX
Description of Project: For this project, we conducted a thorough investigation to pinpoint and comprehend the many elements influencing real estate market pricing. We looked at how factors such as living area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, age of the home, and the existence of amenities like fireplaces, pools, and garage spaces affect the selling price using a dataset that contained the features and values of 700 properties.
Technologies used: Python, pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn
Outcome: The analysis identified that living area, number of bathrooms, and bedrooms have a strong positive correlation with property prices. Amenities like fireplaces, pools, and garage spaces also positively impact prices, while lot size and property age show a negative correlation. These findings are crucial for real estate agents and investors looking to maximize returns on investment. The project demonstrated the importance of specific property attributes in determining market value.
Performed data cleaning and validation to ensure completeness and accuracy of the dataset.
Assessed the impact of missing or inconsistent data on the analysis and findings.
Recommended data governance practices to maintain data integrity for future real estate market analyses.
