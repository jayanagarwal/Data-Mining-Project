PROJECT EXPERIENCE
• Successfully completed projects using R and Python programming, Tableau
• Developed linear regression model to predict quality of wine based on features like fixed acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, volatile acidity, chlorides, density, pH level, free sulfur dioxide, and sulphates, Checked and removed multicollinearity within al features.
