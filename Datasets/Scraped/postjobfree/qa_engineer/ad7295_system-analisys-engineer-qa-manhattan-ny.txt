Dear hiring manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the QA Lead position. With over ten years of experience in QA and support engineering, including project management and business analysis, I am confident in my ability to excel in this role. My recent Master’s degree in Web and Application Development from Touro College - Graduate School of Technology, along with my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, provides a solid foundation for managing complex testing processes.

During my tenure at Motorola Solutions, I served as a QA Engineer, where I applied my expertise in Linux scripting and operating system functionality to identify and address critical issues in RT Embedded communication devices. This role required meticulous attention to detail and effective collaboration with R&D teams to ensure timely issue resolution before product release. In another project, I successfully used a digital RF Attenuator to conduct process analysis on an Android-based communication device, extracting vital debug logs that facilitated pre-production fixes.

In addition to my corporate experience, I managed my own IT support company, RCSoftech, in Israel for five years. This role involved overseeing all aspects of IT support for small to medium-sized businesses, where I tailored solutions to meet diverse client needs. My ability to quickly understand new systems and perform thorough risk analyses was instrumental in delivering high-quality service and maintaining client satisfaction.

Key responsibilities in the Business Testing Manager role align well with my experience:

UAT Testing Management: I have extensive experience running testing calls and facilitating issue remediation between various teams, ensuring effective communication and timely resolution.
Test Planning and Strategy: My background in project management and QA has equipped me with the skills to plan and execute comprehensive testing cycles, ensuring requirements are met and traceability is maintained.
JIRA Management and Reporting: I am proficient in JIRA and have experience managing issues and creating detailed reports for senior management, demonstrating my ability to prioritize defects and provide clear, actionable insights.

As an energetic self-starter, I thrive in dynamic environments and am adept at driving initiatives with minimal direction. My project management experience spans complex institutions, including work with top-tier banks and consulting firms. I am also a strong team player, committed to fostering collaboration and achieving shared goals.

The combination of my technical education, extensive experience in QA and project management, and ability to quickly master new technologies makes me an ideal candidate for this position. I am eager to bring my skills to [Company Name] and contribute to the success of the US FRTB Program.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications in more detail. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Robert Covu
