This is very beneficial to organizations since they can be kept updated on where the donor is in the testing process.

For sites, those are able to accept the electronic orders, and users are able to submit orders electronically. Otherwise order confirmation can be printed and/ or emailed to donor for which can be taken to collection site to begin the collection process using QCS (Form fox) web services. When the QTN lab receives the specimen and results it out, the interim status and final results reach ESP through QCS gateway.
