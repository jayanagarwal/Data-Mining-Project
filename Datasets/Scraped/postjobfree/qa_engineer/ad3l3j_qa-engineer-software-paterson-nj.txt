Managed the development and maintenance of automated functional and regression test suites, leveraging the Cucumber framework with Java and Selenium WebDriver to implement test scripts. Also experienced in the TestNG framework. In developing my testing framework, I implemented a comprehensive approach, combining Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Gherkin for clear feature descriptions, Data-Driven Testing using structured data files for diverse scenarios, JUnit for comprehensive testing support, and Maven for efficient dependency management and build automation. Conducted API testing using Postman and RestAssured library. Performed back-end testing by using MySQL with JDBC.
Carried out Agile/Scrum methodology in collaboration with the Dev Team, actively participating in Sprint Planning, Standup, Review, and Retrospective meetings as per schedule.
Evaluated the test results of the automated test scenarios, generated Cucumber HTML reports, included screenshots of each failed scenario, and documented defects in detail on Jira.
Efficiently used version control by Git together with GitHub repository. Integrated the automated tests into CI/CD pipelines via Jenkins for faster test feedback. Enhanced process efficiency by 50% and reduced waste/time inefficiencies by 30% through Front-end.
Demonstrated comprehensive proficiency in the Selenium Page Object Model (POM) framework, integrating Java and JUnit for robust application testing. Utilized REST Assured libraries and JUnit for API automation, complemented by manual testing with Postman and Swagger for thorough coverage. 2021-2023
