SDET Level 2 at DERIVCO Feb 2023 to current
• In my role as an SDET on a banking project, I collaborated closely with the development team to uphold the integrity and dependability of our banking systems. I took an active part in unit testing, utilizing the same framework as our developers to maintain uniformity and precision in our testing procedures.
• I extensively employed Cypress, a cutting-edge front-end testing tool designed for the contemporary web, for comprehensive end-to-end testing. I later transitioned to Playwright, a Node.js library for automating Chromium, Firefox, and Web Kit browsers, which offered a more robust and reliable testing environment for our web application.
• I possess a high level of expertise in conducting exhaustive front-end and back-end testing, encompassing unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. I have demonstrated proficiency in the strategic design and maintenance of CI/CD pipelines using Microsoft Azure DevOps, with a specialization in C# and SQL.
• I have been acknowledged for my excellence in developing and optimizing automated tests to ensure extensive coverage of both functional and non-functional aspects. I am adept at strategic analysis and meticulous design of test scenarios, with specialized knowledge in seed data strategies. SDET at RCSA June 2020 to January 2023
