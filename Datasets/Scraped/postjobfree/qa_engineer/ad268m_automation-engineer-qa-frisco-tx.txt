Hatch

Project description:

Hatch is a web based platform designed to build kindergarten readiness skills. It is a leading application within preschool educational platforms, that is providing digital teaching materials in 7 different domains: social studies, science and technology, social-emotional development, language and communication, physical development, mathematics, phonics and phonological awareness.
The application contains of Teacher, Student and Parent Dashboards, and my ultimate goal as a QA Automation Engineer is to ensure the delivery of high-quality educational tools that support learning and teaching processes and meets the required quality standards and specifications. My team is responsible for developing, testing, and maintaining any forms and modules that are related to delivering weekly, monthly and annual “student skills progress reports” to teachers and parents, as well as grading functions.
In my project we used Cucumber framework in collaboration with Selenium and Java for automation along with MAVEN build management tool .
The framework is efficient and hybrid in nature supporting BDD and data driven testing followed by POM (page object module) pattern. The tests are being run and verified by JUnit Assertions, and CICD processes were supported with Jenkins. We used Git as our version control tool and Git Hub for our remote repository.
