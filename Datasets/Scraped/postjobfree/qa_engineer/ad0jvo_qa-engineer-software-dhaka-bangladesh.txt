Thesis and Projects
Undergraduate thesis:
Enhancing Crops Production Based on Environmental Status Using Machine Learning Techniques.
Description: A prediction and recommendation model that determines productivity based on the external parameter- humidity, rainfall, and temperature. K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), random forest, naive Bayes' classifier, logistic regression, collaborative filtering, and Multi-Condition Filtering algorithm have been applied. Academic Projects:
1. Safe elevator: an Arduino-based elevator system with a fire alarm to ensure safety and efficiency.
2. Payroll management system: a robust and user-friendly payroll management system using PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS to efficiently manage employee salaries, attendance, and tax information.
3. Stock Price Prediction: Implemented machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, support vector machines, and random forests to accurately predict stock prices based on historical data, providing valuable insights for informed decision making. 4. Smart cap for visually impaired people: an Arduino-based safety eyewear system for visually impaired individuals that utilizes sensors to detect obstacles and alert a designated contact in case of an accident.
