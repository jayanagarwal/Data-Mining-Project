Capstone Project - Automated Mapping of Clinical Terminology to ICD-10 Codes
Chicago State
University, 2024
This project involves developing a machine learning model to automate the mapping of clinical terminology to ICD-10 codes using deep learning techniques. The dataset consists of clinical notes and corresponding ICD-10 codes, which are preprocessed and tokenized before being fed into the model. The neural network architecture includes an embedding layer for word embeddings, an LSTM layer for capturing sequential dependencies, and dense layers for classification. The model is compiled with the categorical cross-entropy loss function and optimized using the Adam algorithm. The training process involves fitting the model on the preprocessed training data and evaluating its performance on a validation set. Accuracy is used as the primary metric to assess the model's performance. Upon training, the model can predict ICD-10 codes for new clinical notes. This approach leverages the power of neural networks to handle the complexity and variability of clinical text, aiming to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical coding.

Medical Waste Management
This project focuses on the application of prompt engineering techniques to develop a comprehensive business proposal for a small-scale medical waste management company using ChatGPT. The initiative involves generating detailed prompts to cover various critical aspects of the business. These prompts guide the AI to provide information on the different types of medical waste, appropriate machinery for handling each type, necessary infrastructure requirements, and optimal location considerations. Additionally, the project outlines an implementation plan and includes financial projections, such as expected profits and returns. By leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities, the project aims to create a detailed, actionable, and efficient business plan tailored for the medical waste management sector. Creating a script and language
This project involves developing a new spoken language by harnessing the capabilities of ChatGPT. The process begins with prompting ChatGPT to provide a comprehensive background on existing scripts and languages, which forms the foundation for creating the new language. Subsequently, I guided the AI through a series of prompts to systematically develop the language's phonetics, alphabets, and grammar rules. By iteratively refining these prompts, the project aims to construct a coherent and functional new language, showcasing the potential of ChatGPT in linguistic innovation and artificial intelligence-assisted language creation.
SQL Database Partitioning
Chicago State
University, 2023
In this project, I led a team of three in partitioning a sample sales database to enhance performance tuning. Our approach involved generating test data and creating the necessary tables for the database. We implemented partitioning based on a monthly partition factor, organizing the data into separate filegroups for each month. This structure allows for efficient access and retrieval, facilitating the easy generation of monthly sales reports. Our efforts aimed to demonstrate the benefits of database partitioning in improving query performance and managing large datasets effectively. Student Service/Personnel applications
Gannon University,
2022
In this project, I developed a Java application designed to manage and display information for college employees, faculty, and student services. Based on the user's selection, the application retrieves and displays the relevant information for the chosen individual, whether they are a college employee, a faculty member, or a student service personnel. This project aimed to streamline access to important personnel information, enhancing the efficiency of administrative tasks and service delivery within the college environment.
