Adrian M. Gonzalez
Linux Systems Engineer

BACKGROUND
For the past 15 years I have been in the IT field with the focus being on Unix. I’ve have experience with hardware support, rack & stack, security, backup administration, cluster configurations, Unix/Linux (Solaris, AIX, RHEx) systems administration and Unix project delivery. I excel as a member of a team or as a lead on a project.
Having been a contractor, I’ve found it necessary to grasp new technologies quickly and I can hit the ground running with minimal advisement from others. I manage pressure well and make it a point to build solid relationships with those around me based on trust and integrity. I have room to grow and welcome new opportunities that challenge me. I am very flexible and adapt very well to new surroundings.

I currently live in Austin, Texas. I thank you for your consideration and hope to speak to you about your opportunity.
