Over more than the past 3 decades I have worked in organizations vary from private to public sectors, from small to multinational. I am an excellent team player who strives to deliver quality solutions. Over the years I have acquired a well- rounded skill sets and I am knowledgeable in many information, telecommunications & engineering technologies. I am willing to go extra miles to tackle challenging tasks, projects and deliver results. Since I often wear many hats in a variety of I.T. projects, as well in systems & network administrations, I would consider myself more as an I.T. generalist rather than a specialist. I do not claim to know everything in I.T., but I will learn quickly when dealing with tasks I don’t already know well. TECHNICAL COMPETENCES
