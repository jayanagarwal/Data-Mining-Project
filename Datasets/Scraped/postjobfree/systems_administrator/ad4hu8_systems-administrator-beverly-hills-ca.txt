SCCM 2203 Admin: ensuring discovery settings would allow usernames in Active Directory groups to populate user group collections, in turn allowing apps to appear in “Software Center.” Adding SQL queries to user group collections, to connect them to Active Directory user groups. Correcting the properties of app “deployment types” and “deployments.”
App remediation/root cause solution discovery: using the “msiexec.exe /l*v” command switch, to create verbose log files, to analyse in great detail why certain (in-house) apps would not function properly, even though they appeared to have completed installation runs with “error code = 0.” Also using the “Sysinternals Procmon” real-time system activity analyser, to see why apps might fail to install or uninstall fully, or fail to launch. Editing MSI files using “Orca” to alter configurations, based on issues uncovered using log files or “Procmon.” Also, triaging between different groups of technicians, to get to the root cause of app issues. And searching far and wide across the Internet, to find fixes to unusual problems. Using “ServiceNow” helpdesk system to track the progress of scores of apps, and their remediation measures. Plus fully documenting solutions for the “ServiceNow” knowledgebase.
Slow login and slow Win10 (VDI) sub-project: analysing, in great detail, why virtual Win10 machines would take twenty minutes to log in, or why they would slow down using user sessions at any time of the working day. Involving: many group policies, Event Viewer analysis, drive mappings, Registry analysis, process explorers, etc.
Application/Windows 10/Windows Server support via the “ServiceNow” helpdesk system: keeping detailed notes on hundreds of cases opened in association with the migration project, tracking progress with regular updates, as solutions were refined, tested and then rollout to users.

Duties:
Helping with a transformation project to migrate thousands of desktops and laptops from Windows XP (SP3) to Windows 7 (64-bit) at many Northants Council sites and offices:
Application discovery: mainly employing SCCM 2012’s Asset Intelligence reporting functionality, which interrogates workstations’ Windows Management Instrumentation database. Also employed was Sysinternals’ utility called “psinfo.exe,” which when used with the “-s” switch for software analysis, creates a highly detailed text file filled with information on software installed on each workstation the utility is run against. This was especially useful for identifying precise version numbers for applications, and pre-requisites (like MS Redist C++ 2008, 2010, 2012, MS DotNet 4,5, etc.).
Finding source media for hundreds of applications (licensed or freeware), plus any installation instructions that may have been stored in network folders, and doing compatibility testing to ensure that the apps would install and function fully within Windows 7 (64-bit). Plus identifying pre-requisites
(like MS DotNets, or MS Dist C++, etc.), by manually installing apps on Windows 7 workstations and analysing dialogue boxes that pop up, or log files.
Application Packaging: capturing and configuring self-installer package (.MSI) files, to be fed into SCCM 2012 Server, for test deployment to Windows 7 workstation, and then user acceptance testing before rollout. Also adding “netsh advfirewall” commands to packages to add firewall rules to Windows 7 workstations. Apps included: “Jaws” (screen reader for blind users), and “Dragon” (speech recognition software).
Helping define and refine the SCCM task sequences used to install Windows 7 (64-bit) workstation, assisting with capturing a reference model WIM file using the ISO image provided by the SCCM 2012 console, injecting hardware drivers into the WIM file using a graphical DISM utility. Plus discovery of apps required by all (Windows 7) desktops and laptops (for example: Citrix Receiver 13.3).
Installing Windows 7 (64-bit) via automated SCCM task sequences using the bootable PXE network interface cards (NICs) in a wide variety of Dell laptops and desktops, the task sequences also installing core apps like: Outlook 2010, MS Office 2010, Adobe Acrobat Reader 11, Citrix Receiver (for access to Citrix-delivered apps via Internet Explorer, etc,.), also adding machines to the correct domain, sometimes manually when required.
Migrating users’ profile data (“my docs,” “IE Favorites,” “desktop” folder icons, etc.) from old Windows XP machines to new Windows 7 workstations, finding folders containing live Outlook PST files to be copied across to new Windows 7 machines, configuring Outlook profiles to open the correct mailbox, and to open the right Outlook PST files, also installing networked and local (USB) printers.
All laptops encrypted using Becrypt’s “Disk Protect” software, with “pre-boot” usernames and passwords issued to users.
Asset info for all desktops and laptops saved in MS Sharepoint data store: asset tags, unique Dell serial numbers, also Active Directory “description field” data used to store machine owners’ names and post codes.
Post-rollout desktop support in: Windows 7 (64-bit) via Sharepoint ticketing system, solving issues via remote control of machines (Microsoft Remote Desktop mostly, and sometimes via the SCCM Console).

Company: B.O.C. Gases (Guildford, Surrey, U.K.)
Job title: Application Discovery/App Packager/SCCM Admin/ (contract)

Duties:
Working on a major project to migrate 3,500 workstations from Windows XP (SP3) to Windows 7 (Enterprise), offering help and analysis to application discovery, packaging and deployment of software (via SCCM):
Discovery of apps in use by the company: organising and clarifying lists of apps (with version numbers) discovered by Centrix agents running on Windows XP machines or using Sysinternals “Psinfo.exe” utility, finding correct source media and installation instruction documentation on the network, analysing the applications’ Registry settings, folder structures, config files, pre-requisites, documenting configuration for later packaging of the apps, with screenshots and plain English descriptions of software components and pre-requisites.
Application packaging: after securing source media and accurate installation and configuration documentation for apps, packaging of the applications to create self-contained MSI files using my own “MSI Generator” software (which I have a full business license for). Some applications captured and configured using the App-V (5.0) Sequencer to create virtualised self-contained MSI packages. Orca (the MSI editor) also employed often, to analyse and reconfigure MSI files.
Administering SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager 2012) Server: creating application package structures, automated installer and uninstaller programs, application deployment collections, and task sequences. Testing and troubleshooting to ensure that applications would install and uninstall silently, and launch under a standard user account. Diagnostics tools included: using the “/l*v” switch at the end of “msiexec.exe /i” command strings in installer batch files, to create verbose (i.e. highly detailed) installation logs, to figure out why an application might not fully install on a target workstation. Also, “Procmon.exe” (from Sysinternals) employed, to view a workstation’s real-time Registry- and file system-related activities during installation attempts of an application, giving insights into installation issues. Also, Windows 7’s Event Viewer employed to identify causes of issues.
Application compatibility testing and remediation: Windows 7 (64-bit) has a 32-bit subsystem called “Syswow64,” which can be used, via application compatibility layer flags set in the Registry, to run “setup.exe” installer files or application program executables, in 32-bit modes (here is the list of possible application compatibility layer flags: Win95, Win98, Win2000, Winxpsp2, Winxpsp3, Vistartm, Vistasp1, Vistasp2, Winsrv03sp1). In this way many unusual applications were reconfigured to work fully in Windows 7, without having to buy newer revisions of software. Also employed was “Windows XP Mode” (a 32-bit virtual WinXP PC within Windows 7) for older software to run in.
SCCM task sequencing: helping to refine the SCCM task sequences to install Windows 7 plus core apps (VPN client, Citrix ICA Client 10.2, MS Office 2010, Outlook 2010, IE 8) using bootable USB drives (with 12Gb of media on them), joining machines to the Windows domain as the final task, creating a zero touch deployment Also, capturing workstation images (.WIM files) using ImageX.exe and SCCM’s own ISO for image capturing. And creating department-specific application deployment task sequences, with sometimes ten or more apps in each sequence, and advertising them to installer collections for each department within the company, to deploy the various apps efficiently.
Deploying applications: approximately 300 software applications were available via SCCM, which were deployed via Active Directory group membership of the users’ computer account names.
Analysis of the Group Policies applied to the Windows XP workstations, to see which ones should be created for, and applied to, the organisational unit for the Windows 7 workstations, providing settings such as screensavers, wallpapers, IE proxy settings, DNS search suffixes, etc.
Post-rollout desktop support in: Windows 7 via a Touchpaper helpdesk ticketing system. Issues and resolved via e-mail, remote control (Remote Desktop), the telephone, or deskside visits.
Software applications included: Citrix ICA Client (10.2), MS Office 2003/2007/2010, Outlook 2010 (with PST files), MS Visio 2003/2010, MS Project 2003/2007, Business Objects (6.5), Lotus Notes (9), Mertec’s FileScan, Protheus 2.2, Oracle (9.2, 10g, 11g), JRE, Attachmate Reflections, DoPDF, Adobe Writer 9 (Standard and Pro), SAP GUI (7.2), Putty, WinCP, CCPulsePlus 8.0, Blackberry Desktop Software (7.1), VMWare Workstation (7.0), Juniper VPN Client, Cisco Webex, Adobe CS4 Suite, and many inhouse apps related to the compressed gas industries.
