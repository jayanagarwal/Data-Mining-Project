Summary
As my former company’s Systems/Network Administrator, I was responsible for the configuration, implementation, and maintenance of various technologies managed by the IT department. I focused on the day-to-day administration of the company's computing resources and network infrastructure which include laptops, desktop PCs, on- prem and collocated/cloud servers, network equipment, and software and SaaS applications. I assessed and identified appropriate solutions to be integrated into my company's systems operation and make recommendations for its implementation.
I possess a solid knowledge of LAN/WAN configurations that includes experience with routers & switches, Internet firewalls, and wireless technology. I have experience setting up and managing database systems such as SQL Server. I possess a background of supporting telephony systems: VoIP-based or standard PBX models. I possess advanced hardware & software troubleshooting skills. I possess quality customer service skills, a strong work ethic, and I’m a team player with the ability to work well independently. I possess above average organization skills and excellent communication skills. I have demonstrated excellent problem-solving skills and are often times considered an out-of-the box thinker and with willingness to learn more.
