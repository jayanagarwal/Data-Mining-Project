Enthusiastic System Administrator with a Master's degree in Computer Science from NYU, specializing in systems programming and cybersecurity. I am committed to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of technology trends.I am nearing the completion of the Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) certiﬁcation by TCM Security, which has honed my skills in OSINT, network pivoting, and Active Directory exploitation—crucial for managing and securing modern IT infrastructures. As a proactive member of the Offensive Security, Incident Response, and Internet Security (OSIRIS) Lab at NYU, I recently led our team to a ﬁrst-place victory in a Kubernetes-themed Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge, demonstrating my ability to apply security practices in real-world scenarios. I have also completed the challenging 'Wreath' network on TryHackMe, contributing to over 90 successful cybersecurity and system administration simulations. These exercises have sharpened my skills in network administration, including advanced routing techniques and secure network conﬁguration.Visit my personal blog at exitvillain.com to view my projects and educational content, where I delve into topics such as system security enhancements and network administration
