My main tasks were troubleshooting issues with the VMware infrastructure and the EMC VNX5300 storage. The issues identiﬁed were hardware as well as software related and resolved adequately. An attempt was made to upgrade the VMware VCenter server from 5.1 to 5.5 earlier this year with no success since there were issues with the SSO and the complex AD of the European Commission with many groups and subgroups – issue that has been later identiﬁed and resolved by VMware with their latest release.
Brocade Fiber switches required proper zoning and all of the hosts in the Hyper-V infrastructure their “host agent” properly installed and conﬁgured.
I had to install and document the procedure of a Hyper-V cluster with 3 hosts and provision storage from the VNX5300 as well as from their iSCSI HP MSA SAN storages.
