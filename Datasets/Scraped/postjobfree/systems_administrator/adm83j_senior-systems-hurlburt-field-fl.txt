Hello there!
Please find attached the accomplishments summary of Jon S. Kernodle, which is submitted to DataTekk to express interest in your Senior Systems Administrator, Mary Esther, FL position. As the summary indicates, I have about 40 years of accomplishments in information technology. My work has been concentrated around the design, implementation and support of new systems to enable communications &
collaboration.
This work started with positions in the National Security Agency as well as the White House Communications Agency, and my education includes both a BA & an MA from George Washingon University as well as 21 IBM certifications. Most recently I just completed a two year contract with prominent defense contractor SAIC to implement & support a new secure mobile communications system for the United States Air Force at Hurlburt Field, Florida playing a key role in the EITaaS contract.
The interim years included work overseas as well as as a variety of corporate roles in addition to positions with several IBM Business Partners. The position with SAIC required a Secret Security Clearance as well as the CompTia Security Plus certification, both of which I obtained. This clearance was an update to the Top Secret/SBI/SCI clearance which I held in the eighties.
I would be available to begin this position as a Senior Systems Administrator, Mary Esther, FL
with DataTekk immediately.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks very much,
Jon S. Kernodle
