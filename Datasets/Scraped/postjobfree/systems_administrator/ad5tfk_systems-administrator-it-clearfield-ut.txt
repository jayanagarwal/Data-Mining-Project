EXPERIENCE
SOAR Transportation group, 977 2100 S, West Valley City, UT 84119— Client Support Technician/ Systems Administrator
September 2019 - March 2021
I served as a System Administrator for SOAR Transportation group as part of their IT support and software aid team. I ensured all necessary updates for both systems and applications were installed, as well as utilizing administration tools to distribute permissions to users and to help onboard and offboard users. I used a ticketing system to help troubleshoot and resolve problems quickly while mitigating data loss, with a First-Call Resolution (FCR) rate of over 95 percent. Mcleod was a common application used among employees and clients, and I was responsible for setting correct client permissions, troubleshooting problems, and helping resolve any issues from both on-site and remote workplaces. After resolving any problems with hardware or software, I updated a OneNote utilized for documentation. Office 365 applications were also utilized, and it was my responsibility to ensure all necessary applications were installed with the principle of least privilege in mind. I also consistently setup users with Outlook accounts and was responsible for troubleshooting any issues regarding Outlook email. SIP phone systems were also utilized daily through a linux distro using SIP asterisk. I managed the phones, distributed extensions with the proper users, created extensions, and terminated extensions depending on the employees employment status. Covid-19 struck shortly after being hired on, so remote devices and working with Virtual Private Networks ( VPN’s) was also a part of my day to day. SOAR Transportation during that time also opened up multiple offices across the country, and onboarding all of the new users was my responsibility, which included utilizing Active Directory for Windows.
Any issues with the remote sites (one in Dallas, Texas and one in Chattanooga, Tennessee) were sent directly to our ticketing system,and I would remote in and help resolve any issues using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). I also would often troubleshoot any hardware issues, such as cabling problems. The hard-wired network utilized Cat5e cabling and I would network the correct wires to the correct servers in the server room, and would also use punch-down tools and other analyzer tools to help troubleshoot any wired problems.

Daylight Donuts, 5471 State St, Murray, UT 84107 — Assistant cook 2015-2019, work weekends and when available
I did a variety of jobs for Daylight Donuts, ranging from a cashier, a building worker, and a shop cook. I’d handle transactions between customers and the store, as well as help customers pick what they want. I was later promoted to an assistant cook, where I’d go in around 1 am to help bake the dough, cook the bread, and decorate the pastries, as well as clean the entire kitchen. When a 2nd store opened I helped prepare it for opening through building management. I replaced the carpet, took down drywall, and made proper blueprint markings for placement of necessary shop equipment. EDUCATION
