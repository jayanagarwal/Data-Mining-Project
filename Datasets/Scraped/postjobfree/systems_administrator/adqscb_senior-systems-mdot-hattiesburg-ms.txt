Ph: 601-***-**** Em: adqscb@r.postjobfree.com LinkedIn: Christopher-shields SUMMARY
I want to bring my 32+ years of IT and network skills, ability, knowledge, and experience to long-term, stable employment. I want to use my God-given gifts to make a real difference in my job, my workplace and to my employer’s continuing business operations. I have a very strong work ethic and take a lot of pride in my job, being my own worst critic. I’m self- motivating, drama free, whine-free, dedicated, loyal, a team player, and a practicing stoic. I’m no stranger to hard work and I don’t mind picking up the slack of others as needed or required at my job. I’m the fallback-on and go-to employee you depend on when Murphy drops in for a visit. I am content to work long hours, to work overnight, to work on weekends and holidays, to work in extreme conditions / emergencies / natural disasters, to work under high stress levels and to do extensive travel and on-site remote work for extended periods of time.

• I travel a lot, mostly the entire Gulf Coast area from LA to AL but as far north as Clarke County, and into other districts as required of me to extend operations out of my home district into other districts when my skills and abilities are needed on special or critical projects.
• Operations and responsibilities include a large main campus area in Hattiesburg (8 buildings), a district lab complex, 2 warehouses, several equipment and vehicle shops, 5 project offices in 5 different counties, a maintenance office in each county (14 total), 3 draw-bridges (waterborne traffic), a regional / EOC office on the coast, 2 traffic control centers, creating and supporting temporary field offices for current projects, supporting users operating remotely in the field (out of vehicles instead of fixed offices) and 11 commercial vehicle / weight enforcement offices including 10 weight enforcement scales offices.
• I currently manage 1 full-time employee (down from 2 full-time employees and a contract worker). I've also taken on local university students in an unpaid co-op arrangement to give these pre-graduation students valuable IT experience to add to their resumes in order to help them place in a job after they graduate.

• Recently promoted to Security Specialist with FGH.
• Extensive LEO training and experience. Extensive interpersonal and people skills especially in diffusing tense situations. Extensive trauma, psyche and abuse experience.
