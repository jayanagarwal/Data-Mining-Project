Summary
Thinking out the box is my norm. I’ve adapted this philosophy throughout my IT career. This philosophy allowed me to juggle multiple hats as a Systems Administrator at NBIS. My most recent position of over 8 years. The first year I started with NBIS I saved the company over 60k a year. I researched vendors for the phone (VOIP) & internet service providers cutting cost and improving performance. Year two I assisted in the negotiation and implementation of moving NBIS to the AWS Cloud (SaaS). Again, streamlining cost, performance and providing the end user a more stable work experience. Plus implementing new disaster recovery polices & Sophos Intercept X for added security. This proved to be instrumental in 2020 during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. It allowed our entire company to work completely remote almost seamlessly for almost two years. Eventually moving the company to a cloud based Office 365 environment with Azure (Entra).
