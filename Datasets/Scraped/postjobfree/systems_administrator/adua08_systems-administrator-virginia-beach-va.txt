To Whom It May Concern,
I currently work as a Cytotechnologist at Sentara Healthcare with over 8 years of experience and am looking to transition my knowledge and technical skills to a more computer based background. I am confident that my education, experience, and skills will help me be successful as I seek to expand my career with your organization.
In my current role, I cover 5 hospitals within our 12-hospital system. Four of the hospitals I support have only one tech working at any given time. Because of this, it requires me to have good time management skills and the ability to communicate timely and clearly with various departments and physicians to ensure quality patient care and safety.
Prior to working in healthcare, I was a teacherâ€™s aide for the City of Virginia Beach. I worked with children who did not qualify for individualized education plans but needed additional assistance with their learning. I worked with these students in math and science and sought ways to effectively communicate with them to meet their personalized needs so they could learn and comprehend the material.
I am a quick learner and thorough individual. I have always been proud to work for Sentara and have learned a lot in my current role. I look forward to transitioning my knowledge and abilities into other areas of our healthcare system and believe that a role as a systems administrator will allow me to continue to expand on my knowledge and passions.
I appreciate your consideration for this position and look forward to hearing from you soon.
Thank you,
Jessica Sheen
