IBM (Internet Security Systems)., Atlanta, GA June 07 to Jan 08

SR. Embedded Software Engineer

The IBM’s ISS group centrally manages family of Proventia multi-function protection products that unify antivirus, firewall, VPN, IDS (Intrusion Detection System), IPS (Intrusion Prevention System), application protection, antispam and content filtering technologies on a single engine. The Proventia Network Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) GX6116 preemptively blocks known and unknown threats like worms, Trojans and spyware, preserving network uptime, reducing emergency patching and preventing security breaches. These appliances sit inline on the network or gateway. Built with two set of processors, the network processor handles high speed processing of network packets and 64 –bit multi-core processor examine traffic across all seven OSI layers. The appliance also offers HA options for continuous protection and network availability.

Responsibilities:

 * Port the common sensor framework, daemon, network engine, SPA Net Protect, PAM, CRM projects from old Linux kernel 2.4 (RHL) to newer Linux kernel 2.6 (Suse derived proprietary Linux kernel).
 * Modify the Makefiles, RPM specs and build scripts for the above mentioned projects for the Gx6116 appliance.
 * Modify the Adapter, NIC, Packet Consumer, Display drivers for the Gx6116 appliance.
 * Modify and validate kernel modules pcilkm, sct and pciinet for Gx6116 appliance.
 * Update the design documents and test scripts for the projects/modules ported to the new platform.

 

Environment: C/C++/Linux (Kernel 2.4 & 2.6), PERL, Shell Scripts, GNU Tools.
