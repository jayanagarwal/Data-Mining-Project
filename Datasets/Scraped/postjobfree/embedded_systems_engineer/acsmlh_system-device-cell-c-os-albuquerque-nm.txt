*** *********, ****** ****, ** 87047 acsmlh@r.postjobfree.com I am an Embedded Systems Engineer, ready to join a winning team and Leading Product.
QUALIFICATIONS SUMMARY
I am an Embedded Mission-Critical Systems Engineer, with several decades of education and experience. I do:
Design of systems, protocols, test beds
Low-level drivers
Board bring-up (a favorite)
Maintenance and enhancement of existing code
Configuration management
Test Beds for both Development and Production
Systems with RTOS’s and bare metal (RTOS type or Metal in technology description)
Board Support Packages
Tool creation
I care about:
Processes (INCOSE by default)
Appropriate Documentation
Clean System Architecture leading to Simple Coding practices with Clear Comments
Good tools, including bug trackers, source control, and automatic static source checking
Lack of ego. I want the team’s ego in the result, not the process. I know:
A variety of languages, including decades of C experience
The whole Product Life Cycle: from requirements to software, hardware, manufacturing, field service
Many different microcontrollers
Computer Science theory, including operating systems, data structures, and state machines
How to “cross the silos” and work with EE’s because I understand how hardware works
How to read schematics and use oscilloscopes (I own one)
Good methods for prototyping
My clients and employers have ranged from very small to very large. I fit well into teams, and providing leadership when asked. I can also work independently when requested, I periodically report progress and needs until finished with the task.
I keep a project logbook to document the process and keep organized. I also keep a daily activity log.
