Title : THERMO ELECTRIC REFRIGERATOR.
Abstract : In order to overcome the problems in conventional refrigerator we developed a small and efficient refrigerator named as Thermoelectric Refrigerator using the small Peltier module, it produces cooling effect similar to the conventional refrigerator, and Peltier module is one which produces cooling effect by absorbing the heat in surrounding environment. This design is lesser in complexity and also cost effective.
Title : DESIGN OF VEHICLE AUTOMATION USING BRAIN WAVE. Abstract : The main work of this project is reading the brain signals, analyzing the brain signals and processing for vehicle control, EEG is the main concept used in this system. Neurosky mind sensor is used as a primitive component for reading the brain signals. The processing and analyzing of brainwave signals are done by TGAM algorithm and esense meter. Then these signals are used to control the vehicle by interfacing Arduino mega microcontroller with other vehicle control systems.
Published technical paper on “Design of vehicle Automation using Brain wave” in IJSR, Volume 5 Issue 5, May 2016.
Attended workshop on “Entrepreneur Development Program”.
Participated in Programmer-2014 in the Livaz National level technical symposium.
