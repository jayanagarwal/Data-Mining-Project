Relevant Projects
Model mediated tele-auscultation system with multimodal feedback : a prototype for a novel system in which a doctor can perform a remote auscultation examination without any assistant. Audio, Video and Force feedback are provided to the doctor who is also able to perform in case of latency thanks to the model mediated implementation of the Force feedback itself.
Inertial Navigation System for pedestrians : trajectory estimation for walking pedestrian using an Inertial Measurement Unit with Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer, Madgwick filter for sensor fusion and the Zero Velocity Update al- gorithm to detect movement.
Design of a WSN for a Smart Greenhouse and realization of a sensor prototype : project and realization of an energy independent sensor for lighting management and humidity sensing in a greenhouse able also to communicate with a web interface to show sensed data.
Design of a Smart Cooktop and realization of a simple prototype : project and realization of a Smart Cooktop managed from a web interface able to select the desired top, to set the start time and the duration of the cooking and to maintain the desired temperature.
