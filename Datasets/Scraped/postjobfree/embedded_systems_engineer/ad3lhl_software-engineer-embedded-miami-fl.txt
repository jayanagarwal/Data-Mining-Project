I thrive in challenging environments and am deeply passionate about learning and engineering critical systems. Over the past 8 months, I’ve worked on acquiring skills in embedded systems, exploring space technology, and developing whitehat projects in Rust. My background is in building Deep Learning & NLP models at Berkeley, developing robust backend software systems at Coursera, and leveraging Rust in various con texts. I am now in search of my next opportunity to advance and grow as both an engineer and leader. Education
