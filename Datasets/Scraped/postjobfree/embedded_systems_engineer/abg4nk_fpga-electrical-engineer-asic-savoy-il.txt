Work Experience

Senior Electrical Engineer
Cobalt Digital, Inc.
Urbana, IL
October 2006-November 2014

FPGA and software development for television audio, video and ancillary
data processing equipment that conforms to industry standards.

Completed Xilinx and Altera FPGA designs for several generations of
processing cards and a control panel and the associated design
documentation.

Implemented Microblaze embedded soft processor and associated peripherals
and defined the interface between the processor and processing modules.
Configured multi port memory controller IP to provide DDR memory access for
the processor and the audio and video processing modules.

Developed display driver module to drive the displays of a control panel.
Designed modules to interface the processor to the rotary encoders and
buttons of the control panel user interface.

Created modules to interface to external audio components via I2S and TDM
interfaces.

Developed frame sync (genlock) IP to lock outgoing video to a reference
source using a video frame buffer implemented in DDR memory.

Designed audio, video and ancillary data processing modules based on SMPTE
standards which also incorporated customer requested features.

Developed C++ software modules for control of the FPGA processing modules.

Design updates tracked via subversion and git revision control systems.

Actively assisted with system hardware/software integration and the
transition to production.

Supported the processing cards through their functional lifetimes.

Lead Electronics Engineer
FlightSafety International, Visual Simulation Systems
Saint Louis, MO
February 1993-October 2006

ASIC and FPGA designer for flight simulator image generators and
projectors.

Implemented image rendering algorithms in digital hardware for multiple
generations of flight simulator image generators.

Projector geometry correction performed by digital logic driving digital to
analog converters.

Performed schematic entry, schematic symbol and simulation model creation
and coding and verification of FPGAs used for interface and functional
logic.

Assisted with development of a Video Post Processor PCIe card used with off
the shelf PC hardware.

Provided prototype board testing and debug and developed JTAG boundary scan
tests.

Developed ASIC design methodology for Synopsys synthesis, simulation and
test development tools and participated in evaluation of potential ASIC
vendors. Designed the boundary scan architecture embedded within the ASICs.

Completed logic design, pre-layout simulation, synthesis, scan insertion,
test vector generation, device pinout and post-layout simulation of several
ASIC designs and coordinated with the ASIC vendor during the layout
process.

Performed system simulation and design documentation.

Developed C language programs for simulation data manipulation and results
verification and diagnostic tests to aid board-level troubleshooting.

Created board and cable drawings in Autocad.

Actively assisted with system hardware/software integration and the
transition to production.

Senior Electronics Engineer
McDonnell Douglas
Saint Louis, MO
September 1986-February 1993

Began development of the VITAL 8 Image Generator (design in progress during
divestiture to FlightSafety). Began ASIC and programmable logic device
development, schematic entry and schematic symbol creation, system
simulation and design documentation.

Developed hardware for the ARIGS Artificial Radar Image Generation System
used in the F-14D and
A-6E/SWIP simulators. This pipelined architecture was built with discrete
logic components, programmable logic devices and an embedded processor.
Performed schematic entry, assembly language coding of the embedded
processor, prototype testing and debug, design documentation and assistance
with the transition to production.

Provided technical support for the MIL-STD-1750A microprocessor program.
