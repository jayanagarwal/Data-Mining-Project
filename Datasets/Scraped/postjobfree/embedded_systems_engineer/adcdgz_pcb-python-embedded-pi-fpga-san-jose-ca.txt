EMG Gesture Recognition System with Flexible High-Density Sensors August 2019 – December 2019 Technology: MATLAB, Machine Learning, Neural Network o Design an end-to end, high-density, wireless EMG gesture recognition system featuring a compact wearable device, facilitate real-time flexibility to communicate with human-computer interfaces o Incorporated multiple features to HD computing and improved robustness of classification, attempt to increase the accuracy o Efficiently analysed different filtering processes and Fourier transforms methods, successfully implemented DWT on EMG signal
o Successfully achieved 96% accuracy by using DWT method on the EMG signal
Gesture Based Wireless Virtual Mouse Controller August 2015 – April 2016 Hardware tools: ADXL335 accelerometer, Bluetooth module HC-05, ATmega16L o Implemented a prototype, this could guide a computer/laptop cursor using hand gestures o Built a wearable mouse which could detect hand position and accordingly shift left and right
Project on Heart Rate Monitoring Using IR Sensor January 2015 – May 2015 Technology: AT89C51 microcontroller with IR sensor LTH1550-01 to detect pulse o Aimed at designing a system which could help human measure their heart rate at home leading to good health tracker o Prepared report of the output along with the accuracy, explicitly mentioned all the case work
Project on PCB design for Hyperion Racing August 2014– February 2015 Technology: KiCad (open source)
o Developed as a PCB designs in Hyperion Racing Team which was organized by FS1 racing in 2014. Mainly designed PCBs for different electronic modules, these modules enhanced the overall performance of car ACHIEVEMENT
Effectively demonstrated great technical and problem-solving skills through the creation of Automation scripts. Strengthen customer relations by proactive response and excellent analytical skills. This helped me fetch SPOT award given by LTI and CBS at Mumbai in December 2017.
