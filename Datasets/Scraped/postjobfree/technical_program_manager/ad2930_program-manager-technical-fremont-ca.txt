• Defined, planned, and executed the program of migrating 10 of 65 microservices from AWS ECS to Kubernetes from its existing legacy platform to a newly developed efficient platform to ensure industry standards in a span of 6 months.
• Experience in leading a program for the database management team. The scope of the program is to make replicas of production databases stripped of sensitive customer information, which is in turn used by the development team. The outcome of this program was a 10% reduction in deployment effort and a 25% reduction in bugs reported.
HR
• Analyzed the existing products and their current release management, identified the manual tasks involved in the existing methods. Initiated a program with stakeholders both in development and operations. Ran a workshop to identify the scope for automation. The findings of the workshop were duly submitted to the program sponsors, who eventually approved them and put them into action as multiple programs progressed to deliver release efficiency.
