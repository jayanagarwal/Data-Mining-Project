Summary Of Qualifications
As an Electrical Engineer, I have worked in the fast paced and demanding field of the Solar Industry. I have an innate ability to work in a self-directed environment due in part by the increasing demand for Renewable Energy. The Solar Panel experiments I helped to conduct test the versatility of amorphous and microcrystalline Thin Film Photovoltaic Solar Panels under extreme high temperature and intense humid conditions. I gathered field results and put together quality reports that present clear statistical data to quickly help assist the Solar Engineering Team in identifying and resolving performance issues. I consistently assisted Solar Engineers in performing experiments to help expose any reliability issues. My efforts helped Solar Panel Engineers develop a successful plan of action for having Solar Panels Pass Final Acceptance Test and helped to successfully acquire UL Certification, IEC Certification and TUV Rheinland Certification for existing customers.
