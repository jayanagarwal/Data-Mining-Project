Achievement Highlights
● Maintained and enhanced a data management platform that exposed Big Data services (Cassandra, Hadoop, & MongoDB) via RESTful web service APIs for consumption by several hundred organizations including internal departments, subsidiaries, and partners of a Fortune 100 enterprise. The Big Data “farm” consists of several hundred servers deployed in a private cloud, aggregating about fifteen hundred terabytes (1,500 TB) of storage. The “farm” routinely ingested millions of records per hour, with peaks around a billion records per hour. Managed support relationships with major vendors including 10gen, Cloudera, and DataStax.
● Led a medium-sized company to launch their statistical analysis software as a paid software-as-a-service (SaaS) hosted in the Amazon public cloud. The system consisted of several EC2 instances running Linux and Windows running their software and a supporting MongoDB cluster. Provided full DevOps support including automated deployments via RightScale, monitoring, and security lockdown (firewalls, etc.) Also launched a Cloudera Hadoop cluster in the Amazon cloud to demonstrate integration of their software, both for public demonstrations (for major conferences and clients) and to certify their software with Cloudera. Assisted development team with adjusting their processes and technology to improve the speed and quality of their releases to the cloud. That included deploying Gradle and Artifactory in support of C# and C++ development.
● Advised massive operations, deployment, and engineering (development) teams on the deployment and operation of a video broadcasting and distribution platform including digital video recording (DVR) and on-demand video playback features. Primarily supported all the Couchbase clusters, but also supported teammates with MongoDB and Oracle databases. Performed numerous hands-on support operations including rebuilding broken Couchbase clusters and troubleshooting production-impacting incidents. Created and managed Amazon EC2 cloud instances and volumes. Managed and supported on-premises servers. Advised on numerous architecture, development, and operations issues and challenges across all levels of the organization.
● Created and supported an entire .NET/Java development environment in the Amazon EC2 cloud for a forty- person team. Launched numerous EC2 instances running Microsoft Windows and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
(RHEL), hosting ESRI ArcGIS, Microsoft IIS, Mule, Microsoft SQL Server, Nexus, Atlassian Bamboo, and Subversion. The environment was designed to support continuous integration and perhaps even continuous delivery of software releases, including software builds, unit testing, integration testing, functional testing, acceptance testing, and release packaging.
● Launched a new service into the Amazon (AWS) cloud that provides data analytics services to a wide variety of industries. The analytics software is a mature desktop client/server application suite that has been re- engineered to function in the cloud. Provided critical expertise to deploy and support Cloudera Hadoop, MongoDB, and TeraData as parts of the new architecture. Also provided critical expertise to automate the deployment/release of all components via the RightScale platform by leveraging BASH and PowerShell, focused towards continuous delivery.
● Supported and enhanced a RESTful web services application programming interface (API) framework that provides a Big Data management platform throughout a world-class enterprise. The platform gives internal groups a plug-and-play solution to integrate Big Data functionality into their applications while requiring technology and skills focused only on calling web services. That functionality includes the capabilities of Cassandra (DataStax), Hadoop (Cloudera, Hive, Pig), and MongoDB (10gen) integrated together (to take best advantage of each technology) scaled to databases of about 500 TB each and data rates up to one billion events per day, managed in a private cloud by a dedicated engineering team.
● Enhanced existing RESTful Java web services to provide identity management for business partners, as a first step towards the productization of those web services as an application programming interface (API) framework. That API allows business partners to price network services and produce proposals/quotes, often valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Wrote a detailed whitepaper describing an architectural roadmap to reengineer that API and its supporting backend systems for scalability and maintainability, based on the REST architectural style.
● Deployed web applications in the cloud (Amazon, Rackspace, Joyent) based on NodeJS, LAMP, and Java.
● Led team of dozens (including overseas outsourcing) to completely integrate and reface (replace the look & feel of) a Fortune 250 company's public website averaging millions of visits per week, under an extremely tight deadline while the CEO and other executives watched. The effort was finished on-time, flawless (not one significant defect registered), and noted by the executives and the popular media. Handled all the challenges of configuration management, source control, and build engineering across local and remote developers.
● Led team effort to redesign and rebuild systems that collected VOIP call data for two million cable subscribers, then staged that data for customer access. Phone call data had to be presented to customers within two minutes of the call being made, while the data arrived in real time at the rate of forty million calls per day (packaged as forty thousand files per day). Led design and implementation of 8 TB Oracle database, Java applications, and web services. Interviewed rest of team. Handled all aspects of IP asset management including source control, environment definition/creation/deployment, plus new developer provisioning. Solved the challenge of a fully- automated build and deployment across multiple (development, test, & production) environments with negligible work to add new target machines. Also supported and enhanced billing systems consisting of 138 TB Oracle database and supporting systems handling forty million dollars monthly gross revenue.
● Chosen by Fortune 250 executives to lead a small team in designing a product prototype in direct partnership with Microsoft. The new product coupled a Windows 7 PC with a digital satellite television receiver to create an amazing multimedia experience. We chose Microsoft’s Media Center (MCML) & .NET technologies to create an appliance-like user interface on the PC that controlled the television receiver, including recording high- definition movies onto the PC then playing them back on a remotely-connected Xbox. This was a very high visibility project, and we were working with pre-release products from both manufacturers.
● Led team effort to support and enhance systems that provisioned (in real time) digital satellite television to thirteen million subscribers and twenty-four million receivers nationwide, representing typically half-a- million-dollars daily gross revenue. Served as release manager that identified and coordinated the business value delivered in each release, among my development team and all others. Designed and implemented migration from PVCS to Subversion source control for population of several hundred developers and other technicians, without interrupting support or delivery. Got promotions for two of my employees with the highest- percentage raises in the entire Fortune 250 company. Supported test and production releases, resolved production failures, supported source control and automated builds.
● Conducted several security assessments of web applications for Fortune 100 financial institutions, involving the static review of source code manually with the support of automated tools (HP Fortify Source Code Analyzer). Provided detailed descriptions of security vulnerabilities, potential mitigation steps, and remediation advice. Provided secure coding training to development teams and their managers.
● Led a team of a dozen to replace a business-critical system using the brand-new Microsoft .NET framework plus SQL Server. I established and managed source control using Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, created an automated build using the brand-new nAnt, and implemented continuous integration using CruiseControl.NET and Draco.NET. We provisioned half-a-dozen new development contractors in less than a day.
● Led team effort to completely redesign and rebuild the systems that provisioned and delivered digital satellite television to a million subscribers, valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Interviewed and hired the rest of the team, then led them in designing the new architecture from scratch. Client flew a small team and me to Switzerland for a week to negotiate and coordinate with a major corporate partner essential to the project's success.
● Served as the Scrum Product Owner role to define the release of business features for a new framework.
● Designed and built configuration management and build engineering processes to support a remote development team using
