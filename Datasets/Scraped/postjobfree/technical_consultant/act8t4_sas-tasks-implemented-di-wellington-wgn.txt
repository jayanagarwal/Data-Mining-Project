Social Housing Reporting
Project Details
MSD wanted a contractor to support the IDU team in generating the housing report mainly from the IPV(Integrated Person View) data. I joined the IDU team and quickly grasped the MSD data concepts and operational model. After 4-5 months, all my coworkers moved to a new work area(SCMS) and I am alone handling the housing report requests. I interact with the business folks who require that specific report and deliver the required output in a timely way.

Project Name
Combined partnership reporting
Project Details
IAG wanted to completely integrate the Lumley and NZI data to create one single, combined report. They wanted to use SAS as the main tool to generate the reports rather than having to use MS Excel to do so. I implemented the above functionality to have the reports generated in a PDF format and automate this report generation every month. I was alone on this project and had to do the design, coding and testing all alone and yet managed to complete this project before the actual deadline.
