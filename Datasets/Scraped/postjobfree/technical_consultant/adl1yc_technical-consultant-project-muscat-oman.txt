• Closure of Issues raised in Penetration Testing: Deployed at Silk Bank, Pakistan for solving the issues raised in penetration testing in their Online Banking OLB module from DBX. Following are the issues: o Username and password are going in plain text from the client-side to the mobile fabric. So, I encrypt it on the Kony Visualizer end and Decrypt in Preprocessor on the mobile fabric end. o Session hijacking due to the saving of authorization keys in cache even after the user logout. So, we updated the Kony Mobile Fabric version with on-call support from Temenos Team. o Solved the ClickJacking issue in Kony DBX OLB.
