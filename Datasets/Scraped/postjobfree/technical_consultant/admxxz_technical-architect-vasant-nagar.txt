The Line Spectral Frequency model of a ﬁnite length sequence and its applications:
• The Line Spectral Frequency(LSF) of a causal ﬁnite length sequence is basically a frequency at which the spectrum of the sequence annihilates or the magnitude spectrum has a spectral null. A ﬁnite length sequence with (L + 1) samples having exactly L-LSFs is referred as an Annihilating(AH) sequence. In 1975 Fumitada Itakura showed that a real minimum-phase sequence can be expressed in terms of LSFs. Peter Kabal and Ramachandran in 1986 gave a working algorithm which lives in every speech coder/mobile-phone today. The article [J2] presents a more precise and an eﬃcient algorithm to compute these LSFs using some spectral properties of sequences (1/3rd the computational cost of Kabal and Ramachandran’s algorithm).
• The concept of LSFs is extended to any arbitrary sequence. This framework develops an LSF model of a causal ﬁnite length sequence with an arbitrary choice of model parameters(arbitrary phase shift and integer delays). An LSF model basically consists of a set of LSFs, complex gains and a procedure/structure to synthesize a sequence or to compute its spectrum. Consequently, a given sequence can be represented by many LSF models each deﬁned by a set of model parameters. The LSF models are also robust for ﬁxed point signal processing operations as they are real and signed fractions. With this novel extension, the LSFs can be used to represent any complex sequence in an eﬃcient format which is amenable to many signal processing operations both in time and frequency domains. The LSF model being a fundamental representation framework of any ﬁnite length sequence has potential applications in the areas of broad-band communications, cognitive radio(spectral sensing), array signal processing, ﬁltering and spectral estimation.
• Key-Result-1:(Time domain application) The LSF model of a sequence is used to obtain a novel canonic ﬁlter(FIR/IIR) structure.
• Key-Result-2:(Frequency domain application) A novel NuFFT(non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform) algo- rithm is presented which uses the LSF model of the sequence for DTFT sampling. The NuFFT is eﬃcient as it uses the non-uniform sampling of the characteristic AH-sequences deﬁned by the LSFs within the LSF model. The eﬃcacy of this NuFFT is more pronounced for sparse and more precise spectral sampling.
• This work also gives insight into some novel properties of LSFs, which can be exploited by many signal processing systems.
