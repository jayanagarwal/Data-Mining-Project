EXPERIENCE:

Using knowledge of the client’s current setup (including but not limited to their Applicant Tracking System, product on the account, and total contract value), partner with internal teams and the client to ensure the best solution to address the client’s integration requirements and specific needs are delivered. Integration setups included job delivery (scraping, mapping, FTP, etc), candidate delivery, and single sign-on access via the client’s ATS to an external system/database.

Premier Support Specialist Lead May 2015 – October 2018
Delivered technical knowledge and was the customer success manager, providing the highest level of service for accounts that met specified requirements. This includes, but is not limited to: managing multiple accounts each with a TCV of at least $1 million, assisting clients via phone interaction/cases that come through the Salesforce queue, supporting complex accounts, and being the pillar for at-risk clients. I implemented new workflows to improve efficiency for our clients, I was the project manager on key implementations, I assisted with getting our client’s to pay for our support, which brought in money for the company, and I was a key piece in getting our company’s biggest client to re-sign for $14 million. I was also the lead over the Premier Support team. To ensure our partnerships stayed strong and both the client’s and our company had a good future outlook, I presented valuable data on client’s current/future standings to internal/external mangers, C-Level executives, and stakeholders. I also ensure that the team continues to ramp up as we on-board more clients, always have positive face-to-face client interactions, and I make sure that I am available/knowledgeable of the software to answer all questions.
