BOBBI HOWARD
I believe collaboration is key, staying curious, and digging for a deep understanding of customer needs drives success. As a servant leader, it’s my passion to help others understand the importance of their work (why), to guide them on milestone alignment (what), and activi- ties/processes (how) needed for success.
