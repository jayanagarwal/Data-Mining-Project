In college, I was nominated and elected by my fellow students to be President of the AITP group at the University of Kentucky. This was a significant honor and substantiated that I was on a career path I would thrive in. I received an offer to work at SIS (#126 on the Inc 500 in 1998) and began doing all things possible with the app dev platform Lotus Notes. Project work advanced from custom apps to web client apps, archiving, automation for migrations, and automation in support of mergers & acquisitions. As my career progresses, I continue to work with larger and more complex systems.
