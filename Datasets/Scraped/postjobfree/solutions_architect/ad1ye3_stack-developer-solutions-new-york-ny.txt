As a contractor, both while employed and between full-time positions, I've served clients as a full-stack engineer, creative technologist, and technology generalist. The majority of the projects being custom web based solutions, public and private, and almost always with at least one or two custom solutions per project
– i.e. dynamic PDF rendering, real-time multi-user updates, dynamic image composition, text-to-speech rendering, etc. I have worked/managed local teams and globally distributed teams to produce mission- critical, highly available interactive applications and websites of all sizes. Additional projects have included custom software, mobile apps, browser extensions, interactive displays, website/SPAs/SaaS development, UX/UI consultation, business workflow optimization/automation, SEO optimization, user-generated content campaigns, web3 connected applications/bots, telemetry/monitoring, and content delivery systems, machine learning/self-optimizing computer vision systems, and much more.
Though my primary work is software/web development, I provide other services as an MSP, including IT consulting and technical support, network installation/management (routers, switches, wireless), VOIP systems, cloud services, on-premise servers, security/camera systems, and more.
