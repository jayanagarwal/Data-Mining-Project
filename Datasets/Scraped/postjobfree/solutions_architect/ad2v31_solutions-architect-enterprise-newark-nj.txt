Sr. Enterprise Architect (hands-on)

Highly effective hands-on security solutions architect / technology leader & strong communicator among all stakeholders, providing strategic vision and execution. Ability to motivate and nurture top engineering talent among global teams. Over 16 years of successful hands-on experience in mobile engineering, innovation, architecture, and thought leadership and consistent delivery of optimal, secure solutions at all levels of the stack. Reliable, consistent, on time, and on budget delivery via building cultures of accountability, planning, and strong working relationships and team-building at scale.

Re-architected, secured, and scaled a rapidly growing, multi-tenant mobile SaaS product platform which required an in-depth understanding of infrastructure, automation, deployment pipeline, cognitive psychology, dopamine UX design, AI, and related sciences to drive cutting edge CRM & communication tech for top brands (including Kroger, Dunken, Unilever, Nestle, Mars / M&M, BIC, Pfizer, P&G, and others).

Invented, patented, engineered, and brought to market an innovative (early AR - 2011) advocate marketing & social networking, and photo sharing product platform (mobile/local/social commerce that harnessed the power of social proof & user creativity), Achieved product-market fit, generating and then growing sales revenue.

Career also includes partnering closely with the CTO and founder in high-visibility lead product / platform architect & software engineer roles at CheapOair.com (3rd largest travel tech brand in the United States, following Expedia and Priceline) - leading the architecture, full stack development, and delivery of innovative & creative new ecommerce & travel technology solutions.

Architected & developed high-traffic, high-availability, Node.js & Python REST API (big data driven) with average response time below 10 ms, supporting 5,000 concurrent connections per server with full Elasticsearch integration via Fluentd log tail daemon (AWS EC2 / EBS, Lambda trigger, nginx reverse proxy, Linux box, API Gateway).

Improved front end render speed by 900 ms by converting the localization key API response data structure from a linear time complexity based array to constant time complexity hash table, leading to a 15% decrease in bounce rate and a 5% increase in conversion rate across mobile, web, & desktop products.

Removed UI lag to improve product UX by changing the existing data structure and writing a custom Suffix Tree to reduce traversal time complexity (achieving O(1) constant time) for a pivotal seat selection tool, leading to a 2% increase in flight conversion rate.

Improved infrastructure for unified digital platform leading to a .93% reduction in operational cost by harnessing a more optimal AWS EC2 cost model approach. Specifically, changed EC2 reserved instance to EC2 spot instance approach, enabling more investment in innovation.

Built & led an award-winning engineering team (winning multiple product awards) at a top $4 Billion travel technology company. Skilled in building, training, and mentoring high-performing engineering teams.
