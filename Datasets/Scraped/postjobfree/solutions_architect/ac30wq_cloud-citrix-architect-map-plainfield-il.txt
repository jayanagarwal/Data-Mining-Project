Summary
Often companies that are ready to scale begin to experience IT challenges. Whether it is continuing to add hardware to support the organization growth, resources are stretched, visibility is limited and control is slipping away, these obstacles not only slow down growth but significantly effect the end users. There are a few vital questions that CIOs should be asking prior to moving data to the cloud:
# Where is your data stored? Location matters for both latency issues as well as the privacy and standards jurisdiction.
# What is the expected reliability? If you have mission-critical data being stored in the cloud, downtime can result is lost business. Make sure you provider has a contingency plan in place.
# What security is in place? Cloud vendors often can provide more security than on premise data centers. Make sure your provider is offering Pen Testing along with Security Assessments to ensure your data is being stored based on your particular needs.
# Do you have a tailored solution? Every business is different, so out of the box cloud services rarely fit the needs of a growing organization. Choose a provider that will create custom solutions to ensure your company can focus on Line of Business workflow.
# Does the provider focus on the End User Experience. No matter how great your data storage is, if it isn’t easily accessible to your staff, clients or users, it will create more help tickets and stretched resources. Make sure your plan is end user focused.
