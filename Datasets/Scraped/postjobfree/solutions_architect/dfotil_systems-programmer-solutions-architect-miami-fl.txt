• Led the development effort to re-engineer a complaint management system which was used to field calls from the general public regarding HUD programs. The system also provided reporting functionality to program directors and the inspector general. The application was written using C#, ASP.NET, the .NET 3.5 Framework, Microsoft’s AJAX framework, and the AJAX Control Toolkit. Re-designed the database to the 3rd normal form and increased query performance by adding appropriate indexes and simplifying joins by using surrogate keys.
