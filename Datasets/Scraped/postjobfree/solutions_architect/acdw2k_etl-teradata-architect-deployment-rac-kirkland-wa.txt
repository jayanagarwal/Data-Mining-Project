STATUS

AFTER SCHOOL B.Sc. Computer Science & Applied Mathematics
QUALIFICATION B.Sc. Hons. In Computer Science, Specializing in:
Artificial Intelligence, Database Management Systems (Oracle)
Decision Support Systems, Linear Programming
Image Processing

SUMMARY I'm an experienced Systems/Solutions Architect with a proven track
record of implementing large, cross-functional enterprise solutions.
They typically include multiple business areas, hardware and software
technologies, software and software design and development. I also
provide organizational support and coordinate deployment resources.
My primary focus is Oracle based data warehouse implementations
(Big Data) and their supporting solution infrastructure, with a
secondary focus on Teradata based warehousing environments

CORE SKILLS: Oracle 9i, Oracle 10g, Oracle RAC 11g, Oracle ASM for RAC,
Senior Oracle PL/SQL development
Software Design at Product Solution Architecture level
Software Development Team management
System/Solution design at Systems Architecture level
Teradata v10, v13 and v14 Data Warehouse design and
implementation
Clustered Solaris 10 implementation for ETL
EMC VMAX Clustered and Dedicated storage,
EMC ISILON OneFS and SyncIQ for NFS

ACHIEVEMENTS Successful end to end system architecture, design and delivery of a
400 terabyte near transactional Oracle RAC 11g Data Warehouse -
the largest of its kind worldwide, associated deliveries included:
• Detailed storage forecast models for database and ETL platforms
proven to be within 95% accurate of actual storage requirements
• Significantly reduced manual support and delivery resource
requirements, and increased delivery quality through the
development of multiple supporting Oracle Data Definition
Manipulation processes & packages, for use in most common
customer change requests and data interface updates/upgrades
• Custom development and delivery of specialized data interfaces in
PL/SQL
• Managed the custom development team responsible for providing
the delivery of multiple specialized data interfaces. All
customization met, and often exceeded, data quality and
availability measurements established by the customer
• Responsible for multiple product software enhancement design
and new components to meet the customer’s specific needs
• Responsible for leading the team through all phases of the project
from analysis and requirements definition to production
implementation
EXPERIENCE
AIRCOM International (USA Hub Office) October 2009 to
Current
Systems Architect, AT&T Optima project

PRIDE Teradata platform implementation/migration:
• Design end to end systems Architecture for a distributed collection and
mediation layer supporting an Teradata v14 warehouse
• Design and plan the migration from the Original Oracle RAC system and
attached mediation to the PRIDE Terada warehouse (EDW) platform
• Guide product research and development to align future product release with
Client and Teradata specific requirements to ensure a ‘fit for purpose’ approach
to the Teradata solution
• Provided key input in product level Solution Requirement Documentation (SRD)
and High Level Design (HLD) documentation
• Owned quality assurance by verifying delivered product against solution
requirements and highlight all deltas on an ongoing basis
• Consolidate customer requirements and feedback with Product Architecture and
Development teams as the primary point of contact for technical matters on the
PRIDE Teradata migration project
• Provide technical guidance and process documentation for modular migration of
Oracle based interfaces/data areas to the PRIDE Teradata platform
• Manage the Custom Scorecard Interface (CSI) specialist team including a
solutions Architect, developer, and delivery engineers and their end deliverables
– CSI is a highly specialized reporting layer consisting of complex aggregation
of data and the final presentation of that data for reporting purposes. These
reports and their underlying data sets typically span all major areas of the data
acquired into the Optima warehouse

Original Oracle RAC implementation:
• Design Optima performance management solution for AT&T mobility across all
American markets and all vendor technologies integrated into the AT&T mobile
network, including the upcoming LTE network
• Architect the design and maintenance of a Oracle RAC Cluster system scoped
at approximately 270 TB in size for the ongoing acquisition of the performance
measurement data, this includes high level storage array distribution, RAC node
distribution across host machines and domains and node affinity definition
across the entire platform
• Architect and develop any specialized data acquisition processes including
CMPM configuration management data synchronization between Optima and
various external systems
• Define and Architect ongoing vendor interface integration into the Optima
system to ensure manageability across the AT&T Optima platform
• Architect and manage the hardware and storage environment for the ETL layer
or “Mediation Layer” aimed at acquiring raw performance data, pre processing
this data and loading data into an enterprise Oracle RAC cluster
• Audit and Maintain system solution specification and design documentation
relating to the AT&T Optima platform
