OBJECTIVE
To obtain a full time, senior level position involved in mechanical engineering/control engineering/software development to fully utilize my skills and further develop myself.

EDUCATION
Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, 2010, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida GPA: 3.6/4.0
M.S. in Computer Science, 2006, Jacob University Bremen, Bremen, Germany
B.E. in Information Engineering, 1999, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China
• Patent, China Patent # 97227260.7, Universal Multi-shaft System for Group Machining, issued September 26, 1997.

EXPERIENCE
Project Leader , Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida February 2006 – present
• Served as team leader for complex coordination strategies of heterogeneous robot teams by employing economic principles.
o Reconstruct 3D scenes for distributed multi-robot resource coordination using Microsoft’s Kinect.
o Proposed, implemented and tested Stochastic Cluster Auctions that can trade off global optimal performance and team efficiency.
o Integrated the QorIQ P4080 processor (8-core) into the physical experiments of multi-robot communication for combined control and dataplane processing, enabling 4 times improvement in computational and communication performance.
o Wrote C++ codes for auction protocol and coordination strategy in GDB, GCC, and Eclipse IDE.
o Accomplished physical experiments for multi-robot communication (TCP/IP) in JAUS SDK.
• Developed a robotic vehicle from concept to final product, including embedded control firmware/hardware/software integration, control system design, motion control, real time data logging and sensors installation.
o Programmed and configured PC104 embedded control software and hardware system, including microprocessor board, DAQ board, DC/DC board, sensors, encoder, Ethernet converter, etc.
o Modeled and simulated vehicle closed-loop control system in Matlab/Simulink, including PID controller, motor drive, motor and vehicle dynamics.
o Wrote firmware in C code in VxWorks for ADC, DAC, counter and timer, and wrote the main program for robot motion control, including programming low pass filter, PID controller and robot kinematics.
o Programmed path planning algorithms in C code to control robot to follow trajectories to reduce time, distance or energy, and fed sensor data in VxWorks to ensure robot follow the desired trajectories.
o Collected experimental data from sensors, performed root cause analysis of experimental data, debugged programs and developed new experiments.
o Processed experimental data through optimization methods to determine unknown parameters, and designed low pass filters to reduce data noise.
• Wrote LabVIEW code on PXI platform to retrieve pressure/position/temperature data, model positioning system in pitch/yaw, and control wind tunnel airspeed.

Researcher , Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany November 2003 - January 2006
• Evaluated rescue robot behaviors in Urban Search and Rescue Simulation based on the Unreal Tournament game engine, proposed a novel strategy, and improved its efficacy on various complex environments by 15%.
• Planned motions for multiple robot simulation in new directions using OpenGL, Qt and the FOX GUI Toolkits' marriage libraries-the Motion Strategy Library.
• Designed frontend for fast robot prototyping using Cognex vision system.

Engineer , Nanyang Technological University, Singapore January 2002 - March 2003
• Investigated automotive vehicle longitudinal control and developed a new learning switch strategy for throttle and brake control.
• Devised two computed control signals to determine whether to activate the throttle, or the brake, or inaction.
• Demonstrated the resulting control law renders dramatically smooth behaviors for vehicle tracking.

Engineer , Guo Li Geothermic Co., Kaifeng, China October 2000 - January 2002
• Integrated an HVAC Geothermal Heating system with Heat Pumps.
• Developed the interface with the hardware using the MicroLogix controller.
• Consolidated the system which operates in a harsh environment robustly.

Engineer , Tian Yu Building Automation Systems Co., Nanjing, China September 1999 - October 2000
• Built Human System Interface, and integrated information such as module type, status, and setup options in easily comprehensible text.
• Instituted that all process actions were determined in Honeywell DCS, which leads the system to exceed the highest standards of quality by 20%.
