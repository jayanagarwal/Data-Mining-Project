EXPERIENCE
University of Cincinnati, Ohio
Research Assistant September 2016 - Present
● Position, attitude, and fault-tolerant control of the tilt-rotor quadcopter using PID and sliding mode control techniques
● Development of ﬂight software and hardware implementation using Pixhawk Pilot Support Package (PSP) by Mathworks
