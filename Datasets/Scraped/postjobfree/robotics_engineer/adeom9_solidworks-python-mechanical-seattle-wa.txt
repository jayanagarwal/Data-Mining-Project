●Reconstructed a 3D scene and obtained the poses of a monocular camera w.r.t. the given scene.
●Applied Fundamental Matrix estimation, RANSAC, triangulations to reconstruct the model from 2D images.

Traffic Sign Detection - Computer Vision/Machine Learning Oct 2019
●Used MSER features and an SVM classifier to detect traffic signs and make a bounding box around them.
●Implemented HSV and MSER features to achieve robust sign detection(90.3%) using SVM for classification.

Buoy Detection & Color Segmentation - Computer Vision Sep 2019
●Continuously tracked 3 different colored underwater buoys from the Dashcam video of USV.
●Obtained tight segmentation using Gaussian mixture models to learn the color distribution and detect buoys.

Advanced Lane Finding - Computer Vision Aug 2019
●Applied sliding window tracking technique to a dashcam video to track lanes under changing conditions.
●The algorithm tracks the lanes accurately and gives a correct indication of lane curvature and vehicle offset.
