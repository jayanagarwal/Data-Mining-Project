Work Experience
Near Earth Autonomy - Robotics Engineer November 2022 - April 2023
● Helped establish a stable, feature-rich codebase upon which other teams could rapidly prototype
● Developed prototype code into a production quality for a more robust execution and readability
● Worked with my team to help migrate the codebase from ROS to ROS2 Rugged Robotics - Robotic Operations Engineer July 2021 - June 2022
● Owned the planning cycle and operation of construction robots on jobsites navigating physical obstacles such as debris, walls, pillars, and pipes
● Defined software requirements for the production-level layout robot, suggesting optimized solutions for path planning
● Managed the logistics of competing subcontractor dependencies, reducing job time by 16%.
● Implemented an automated calibration procedure in Python to improve robot accuracy by reducing maximum angular deviation from 10 degrees to 5 degrees using ROS in Ubuntu 18.04
● Developed software to ensure separate distance-measuring sensors on the robot could operate independently without interference as a ROS node in a Ubuntu environment Indicus Software - Internship July 2019 - August 2019
● Trained a video analysis algorithm with machine learning libraries such as OpenCV in Python
● Learned about different communication protocols such as MQTT Projects
Election Predictor (Independent Study)
● Parsed data collected from congressional databases using a scraper written in JavaScript
● Trained a neural net in Python to predict the political party of the next representative from each district based on data such as population density, median income, median age, etc. FIRST Robotics Team - CAD Lead September 2014 - June 2017
● Led a team to design (SolidWorks) and assemble a robot to solve a variety of challenges such as climbing a rope, ejecting plastic discs, and launching wiffle balls
● Placed first in the international 2016 First Robotics Competition Education
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - Bachelor - Computer Engineering 2021
● Built a RISC-V pipelined processor with SystemVerilog and C++ on an Intel FPGA
● Developed an operating system with I/O interfaces, scheduling, and memory virtualization with x86 Assembly and C++
● Programmed a UR3 robotic arm to stack blocks using ROSpy and applied robot kinematics
● Created a reaction wheel with a tuned PID loop to balance a pendulum
● Programmed image recognition software for birds and faces with OpenCV, PyTorch, and Tensorflow libraries
