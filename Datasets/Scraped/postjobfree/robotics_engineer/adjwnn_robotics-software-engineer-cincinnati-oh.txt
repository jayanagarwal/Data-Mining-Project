I am interested in Robotics Software Engineer position at Neato Robotics as advertised on LinkedIn. I am excited to see that my qualifications and skills aligns well with the Job’s requirement. I am an MS student at the University of Cincinnati majoring in Aerospace Engineering. I have expertise under Robotics and Controls and am currently doing my thesis on “Hybrid VTOL box wing Quadcopter”. This job posting aligns with my work experience in projects which involves developing controllers of robotic dynamics and kinematics system in ROS Python. The controller developed is a very useful design to avoid obstacles along with localization and path planning. Being a research student requires lots of patience and constant effort along with ability to use the information for innovations, which I have gained during the process. I feel these skill sets will be very useful in the job at Neato Robotics.

I have done under graduation in Aeronautical Engineering. My final year project was based on Aerodynamical Analysis of “Tubercles on leading edge of wing” which was done using Fluent Ansys. I am always a very enthusiastic person and tend to keep learning. This motivated me to attend workshops on aeromodelling and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) which lead me to design and fabricate my own R/C planes and a Hexacopter. To further enhance my skills, I have learned software’s and programming skills like SolidWorks, Catia, MATLAB, Simulink, Ansys, C++.

I also had an opportunity to intern at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in Tejas Division where I was exposed to the hardware involved in the control systems sub-division. This internship was my first-hand training which gave me experience to manage work between workshop and office jobs, this also allowed me to showcase my time efficiency. After my Bachelors I got opportunity to work as a Mechanical Design engineer, where I got trained and got experience at an industry which deals with hydraulics, where I got to learn of a plethora about manufacturing techniques, and knowledge of the different materials used in manufacture. I have hands on experience in CAD drawings and designing hydraulic cylinders and mechanical machine parts, along with various manufacturing methods including machine shop equipment. This has enhanced my ability to be a great team player and to work with diverse yet similar field work experience.

With all the knowledge I have gained so far, I would like to use this experience to pursue my passion for robotics and controls where I desire to learn and work passionately. I look forward to being a part of Neato Robotics and contributing to the best of my abilities.
