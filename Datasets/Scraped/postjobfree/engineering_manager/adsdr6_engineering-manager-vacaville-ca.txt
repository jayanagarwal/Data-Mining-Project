EMPLOYMENT HISTORY
WANdisco, San Ramon
Engineering Manager Mar 2020 – Nov 2021
Responsible for driving the integration of the LiveData Migrator as a first-party application within the Azure marketplace. This involved managing a team of 6 engineers and close collaboration with Microsoft stakeholders to allow an extension of the RPaaS (Resource Provider as a Service) within their ARM (Azure Resource Management) framework.

Mentoring/growth of our SCRUM team using Agile methodology and planning the execution of features involving WANdisco suite of products. These solutions solve single point-of-failure problems across a distributed environment, achieved by leveraging our patented Distributed Consensus Engine (DConE). My additional role as ScrumMaster required distilling stories into recognized work items within JIRA and driving the ceremonies with a goal of continuous improvement.

Sr. Software Engineer Jan 2015 – Feb 2020
Fusion Resource Provider - Required working partnership with Microsoft to integrate the WANdisco products Fusion and Live-Data Migrator into their Azure marketplace. We build on the Microsoft RPaaS platform which allows our WANdisco products to present and behave as an Azure resource.
Technologies Used: Java, Python, Spring Boot, REST, Azure, Docker, Jenkins, JIRA, Agile

Fusion Core - Worked on the core product implemented using the DConE co-ordination engine based on the PAXOS algorithm, we use this to solve consensus issues particularly within a distributed HDFS system. Fusion enables data to be replicated between distributed Hadoop file systems, which can reside on-prem or in the cloud. Notable features I worked on included a Consistency Check which scans the source and destination file systems and detects the inconsistent files, and the multi-threaded Repair Functionality that resolves the inconsistencies. Code was built and made available using Jenkins from Git repos.
Technologies Used: Java, Hadoop, Jenkins, JIRA, Jenkins, Kafka/Storm

Fusion Backup - Implemented a plugin to Fusion Core which backs up data continuously when update events are received. The solution is filesystem agnostic and was designed to backup data on HDFS and AWS, the solution also enabled periodic snapshot backups for data on HDFS using CRON libraries.
Technologies Used: Java, AWS, HDFS, Jenkins, JIRA, Jenkins

WANdisco, Belfast Jan 2013 – Dec 2014
Sr. Software Engineer
NsNN integration - Integrated WANdisco data replication technology within Hadoop management systems by creating an installer that deployed the NsNN software to an active Hadoop cluster. I contributing code to the Hadoop open-source community, and helped refine the SPARK and SHARK open-source technologies.
Technologies Used: Java, Groovy, Jenkins

Hippo - Created a front-end representation of the current Hadoop administration screens and required updating open-source REST and JMX calls, using a Tomcat web server.
Technologies Used: Grails, JQuery, Java, Jenkins, Tomcat

IBM, Belfast Feb 2010 – Dec 2012
Sr. Software Engineer
Worked within the Tivoli family of products and incorporated TDD within the process:

Early Program Management - Managed the beta testing of new software releases of IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager (ITCAM) which provided stakeholders early access to development plans, designs, and code.

IBM Integration - Worked with the team to integrate DB2 and WebSphere into ITNCM, this was performed in JAVA with heavy reliance on JUnit testing.

Service Management Interface - POC for IBM's Cloud concept to facilitate dynamic network reconfiguration, implemented through RESTful web services with JAVA and Spring MVC.

SNMP Enablement - Implemented a new genre of driver for a single ITNCM customer. Required SNMP protocol and MIB knowledge, implemented in JAVA.

Intelliden, Belfast May 2006 – Jan 2010
