I hold PhD degree in Civil Engineering - Structures and Construction Materials since February 2022. From 2016 to 2017, I was the Chairman of the Civil Engineering Department at the Koya University’s Faculty of Engineering. My MSc in Structural Engineering is from the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom, and my BSc in Building Construction is from the University of Sulaimani in KRG/Iraq. Since graduating in 2001 and up to 2013, I have worked in the commercial and public sectors in a variety of professions, including project supervision and management, new and rehabilitation projects, tendering process, construction-related committees, and as a designer for several civil-engineering projects. I have worked as a supervisor engineer, an office and designer engineer, and as a project administrative director. With an experience of more than 20 years, currently, I hold the rank of a civil engineering consultant.
In the academic field, with a grade point average of 68.69 percent and a ranking of fourth out of 23 students, I was recognized among the top graduates in my undergraduate level of study. My government later qualified me for a scholarship, and I completed my MSc in Sheffield, United Kingdom, in 2014. Since 2015, I have been a lecturer at Koya University’s Engineering Faculty, and as well as a consultant for Koya University’s Project Department.
Academic Experience
PhD in Structure and Construction Materials Sep/2017- Feb/2022 PhD dissertation "Torsional behavior of high-strength concrete box girders reinforced with Basalt Reinforced Polymer Bars".
Chairman of Civil Engineering Department Aug/2016 – Oct/2017 Civil Engineering Department/ Faculty of Engineering, Koya University In this position, I have mainly focused on developing the curriculum and syllabus of modules to the latest science, upgrading the educational software programs and book references to the latest versions, and using the most recent methods for both teaching and administration purposes.
