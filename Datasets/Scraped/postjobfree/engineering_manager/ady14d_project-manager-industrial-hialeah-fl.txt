Professional Experience
Amgen Manufacturing Limited (July 2018 – Present)
Sr. Engineer – Supply Chain / Industrial Engineer
• Developed capacity analysis with a strategic thinking to organize products by manufacturing line to ensure we meet the current and future demand in Latest Estimate (LE) and Long Range Strategy (LRS) processes.
• Developed several capacity analyses to support business cases of new products considering line capabilities, implementation of new equipment and line performance. In Addition, I provided support throughout the process from capacity analysis to the implementation of the product in the line.
• Developed a strategy to off-load volume from High Mix Low Volume (HMLV) lines to a new line choosing products that allowed us to meet demand from 2022-2024. Additionally, I led an OEE Workstream of this new HMLV line providing guidance to a cross functional team to ensure a successful line start-up.
• Led a project that won the second place in Excellence in Operation Awards. The project title was: Strategy to improve HMLV line by incorporating a modular layout and one-piece flow process. After this project line has a flexible layout that can be changed by product depending on the packaging configuration.
• Provided support to develop a strategy called Unlock Capacity to increase OEE in packaging lines. Led and provide guidance to the cross functional team to create a strategic plan to achieve more than 20% OEE increase. Additionally, I develop multiple dashboards in smartsheet to facilitate forum discussions and monitor initiatives by line.
• Created standard work for several manufacturing lines to ensure standardized processes in order to have the maximum output per line.
• Facilitated several Kaizen to determine opportunities to improve packaging lines processes.
• Currently developing a project to reduce changeover time and increase OEE by implementing a strategy to organize lot in schedule by campaign.
Amgen Manufacturing Limited (Oct 2016 – July 2018) Engineer – Operations Improvement / Inspection & Packaging
• Determined the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) targets for all inspection and Packaging lines.
• Analyzed the productivity for all lines, performed OEE report to evaluate this productivity and the major offenders in downtime to propose improvement initiatives.
• Create a new version of OEE Report, reducing 50% of time required to prepare it.
• Performed capacity assessments, analyzed the process changes and made recommendations.
• Evaluated line with high capacity utilization and made recommendations for 30% capacity increase.
• Led Time Studies to validate the current Units per minutes (UPMs) by line and implemented the UPMs for a new high mix low volume line, enable OEE implementation. Internal Use Only General and Administrative
• Performed labor model analysis to establish operator workload and made recommendations to balance the line. The results were presented to Directors and Sr. managers.
• Created and implemented standard works to standardize the process, reduce changeover time and improve productivity.
• Proposed a 5’s strategy to site implementation and an effective 5’s training.
• Led and created a Lean Six Sigma trainings to apply concepts and methodology such as Waste Reduction, SMED, Visual Management and Standard Work.
• Facilitated Kaizen events, prioritized ideas and guided implementation for continuous improvement.
• Standardized daily shift report for the shift change to improve reporting and communication. Lily del Caribe (Jan 2015 – Dec 2015)
Graduate Coop – Operational Excellence
• Performed a capacity analysis to prevent and solve changes in the forecast demand.
• Led and supported a Kaizen event to simply the new product introduction and lab method transfer processes. The results showed a time reduction of 1 month (33% less time than the current process) and 3 months (37% less time than the current process) respectively.
• Monitored and supervised the implementation of raw materials for new product introduction process. As a result, this project ended 2 weeks before the expected time.
• Led time study, performed a capacity analysis for incoming process and implemented a new layout.
• Created and implemented new layout for offices area.
• Used Lean problem solving tools, such as fishbone and 5 why’s to analyze possible root causes of defects in the product.
• Documented all Green Belt projects of the year using Lean methodology to determine benefits for each one.
University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus (Jan 2013 – Dec 2014) Teacher Assistant -Industrial Engineering Department
• Provided mentoring and guidance in Automation and Process control class.
• Guided students to reach their class goals.
• Promoted a creative thinking to problem solving.
• Teacher PLC language, circuit assembly, HMI and PLC programing. Edwards Life Science (Capstone) (Aug 2012 – Dec 2012) Industrial Engineer -Manufacturing
• Led time study and line balancing for the assembly process and made recommendations to increase productivity.
• Performed a simulation using SIMIO program to analyze and prove the proposed changes.
• Made recommendations to modify current layout, reducing waste and contributing to increase operator efficiency.
Research Experience
Thesis: The Analysis of Omics to understand Alzheimer Disease (May 2014 – Dec 2015)
• Determined potential biomarkers of Alzheimer disease, analyzing genetic expression value between control and Alzheimer patients using Minitab and Matlab programs.
• Proposed potential biomarkers of MicroRNAs related with Alzheimer.
• Proposed a relationship between potential biomarkers of Alzheimer genes and potential biomarkers of Alzheimer MicroRNAs.
