Petro Constructors LLC is an EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) company based in Houston, Texas targeting the petro chemical industry. I was in charge of creating a subsidiary for detailed design engineering in Chennai, India. I created and managed an engineering company, the team of engineers covers all the specialties required to design and commission a chemical plant. This company delivered detailed engineering package to the corporate office in Texas. All designs followed US standards and I had to train the staff to different US standards: ASME, API, OSHA, IBC, NFPA and NEC.
The company had 5 departments:
1) Design: 6 chemical engineers with experience in Petro Chemical and Biodiesel processes. a. Heat and Mass Balance, PFD, P&ID
2) Mechanical: 15 engineers, ran ASME and API design calculation, created 2D and 3D drawings for vessels and plants using Autocad 3D and Cadworx. a. Fabrication drawings with BOM
3) I&E: 5 engineers, Allen Bradley and Siemens PLC design, fabrication and programming, electrical design, specs and datasheet, instrumentation selection, specs and datasheet 4) Procurement and Project manager: 3 employees, Project management and Procurement of parts and equipment.
5) QA/QC: 1 manager.
I created the legal entity and had to implement all the administrative support to run an engineering company in India (legal, accounting, payroll, registration). I supervised and coordinated activities between this engineering team in India (25+ engineers and researchers) and a fabrication and construction team in Texas (50+ employees). After only one and a half year, I had the company certified for ISO9001:2008 for its quality management system.
Achievements: Design, construction and delivery of a 250 tons/day vegetable oil refinery in Alabama in 2011. Petro constructors Private limited was in charge of the entire engineering except structural engineering and civil work engineering that were performed by PEs from Alabama and Texas.
I worked with Project managers in the US to review and approve procurements of the parts and equipment that were not procured by us in India. Site inspection, staff training and commissioning were also conducted by the Indian company. Huu-Nghia VUONG

Sonorawest Co Inc, Houston, TX (March 2007-January 2008) Director of engineering
Supervised and coordinated activities between a consulting engineering team in India
(10 engineers and researchers) and a commissioning team in Houston (3 engineers, 15 operators and management) to commission and qualify a bio-diesel production plant.
In charge of the air and emission permits for the plant. My main focus was:
- Motor Control Center: Design, Verification and Test. Using DOL, Star-Delta, Soft starters and Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)
- Process automation: Specify PLC specifications, SCADA interface, install and test DCS systems. Install remote access to PLC
- Maintain on-line documentation, redline Autocad files for modification by designers
- Supervise class 1, division1 and division2 wiring configurations and installations Actel Corporation, Mountain View, CA (1998-2007)
• 2004-2007: Verification and Validation Manager. Three years as a verification and validation manager, in charge of three teams:
Pre tape-out verification
Post fab-out Product Validation
Post fab-out manufacturing tests development.
(14 engineers, over three countries: USA, Germany and India) o Complete Programmed Chip simulation using simulation Hardware accelerator (Zycad) or verilog software simulation (Verilog). I brought state of the art solutions (co-verification, code coverage, fault coverage, formal verification and assertion verification) inside our verification flow and had the team grow from 2 engineers to 9 engineers in two years. o Product Validation: Implement designs defined from our products’ use model. This verification was done using the tools provided to Actel’s customers. This is a step that I added to our verification flow that allowed us to verify our software support through CDL simulation and silicon verification. o Manufacturing tests: The team was in charge of developing the tests programs that were run on every chip Actel shipped to customers. This involved complete routing switches verification as well as IP verification thru JTAG interface, BIST using Scan-insertion with DFT-compiler and ATPG with Tetramax. Fault coverage for customs tests were measured using Turbo-Fault.
o In my last 2 and a half years at Actel, I started the Actel Off-shoring process by creating a team of 8 engineers in India, running logical verification and manufacturing tests development under my supervision. I worked with Huu-Nghia VUONG
