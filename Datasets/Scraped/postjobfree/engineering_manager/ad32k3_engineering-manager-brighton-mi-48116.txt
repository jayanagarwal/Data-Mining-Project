Metrology & Chemical Laboratory Manager Feb2020-Present
• Promoted to Metrology & Chemical Manager with my extensive Metrology and Engineering background.
• Position encompassed the Incoming Inspection Dept joining the Metrology Dept to have one Team to be the Technical Measurement Services Group for the TREMEC Corporation.
• Accessed current practices and staffs accountable support for ethical operations. Defined the changes and the protocol the team member were to follow for Communication, Data reporting and compliance with Traceability to the IATF Standards.
• Participated in retraining the Team on the measurement software’s used in the lab, defined the training certification to be followed and reviewed by our internal IATF certified auditors and the manufactures Senior programming staff. This change made a positive work environment platform to having a happy staff and even happier internal and external customer that receive data and communication through very clearly defined reporting formats using PowerPoint and video data sets.
• Creating the new Corporate Workflow System in Power Apps as SharePoint was phased out, this allows the customer to have 24hr access to their secured data documents traceable to the work order.
• Designed a new work location in the plant to bring together the Measurement and Chemical teams, presented the scenario to corporate for approval, coordinated commercial contractors, equipment riggers, equipment calibration manufactures and all while keeping the labs operational with a 2 day down time to make the moves. Having outside services ready and PO’s in place to support the plants needs during that time. Cost savings in the staff having less walk time and safety concerns with parts on carts and Hilo traffic was $165k. The costs for the complete project in total including staff time being engaged was $158K.
• I am the financially responsible Manager for all Quality Dept cost tracking, purchase requestion & PO approval. I dually support accounts receivable/payable for prompt payment to suppliers to the Quality Dept for cost savings negotiated during the quoting phase. This has saved to date $395K in spending allowing the Quality Dept Manger to show a metric of under budget for the past two years.
• TREMEC’s new Romulus Distribution center added a new support challenge as we now ship to TREMEC Wixom and GM-St. Catherine’s, our work order system was revised to support a Skip Lot process so the Labs could be sent material for inspection and certified material would be returned to the container it was removed from and shipped with documentation for the end user. This process requires engagement each day from the coordinators in the labs and MP&L staff @ the DC. GM was added to the document centers CWF for Canada’s access to the traceable documentation noted on the shipped materials per IATF Guidelines and the Contract with GM.
• I oversee the Chemical teams’ operations daily, giving guidance to the standards for best practices and safety adherences while handling volatile chemical and maneuvering parts in the Pall cabinet and inspection process for cleanliness and particulate data collection.
• My dept follows strict inventory of all equipment and consumables, chemicals are processed 1 time per week and evaluated from the usage excel documents from each cabinets main inventory. These process and protocols have been adopted by the QRO-MX & Belgium Operations as Company standards.
• The efforts of ethics, accountability and measurement and communication are noted by the teams and managers from the kuo-TREMEC Corporate companies is seen by the number of staff that visit the Wixom Quality dept to learn and be a part of the processes that have been set as the Standards by which the Company operates.
• I have the highest staff retention scale in the Plant, my staff have been promoted to other positions and 2 to Supervisory roles. This I believe is due to my mentoring, work ethics and care for developing a great work environment to grow talent in.
• I am part of the IATF Integration team, teaching other departments how IATF works, and how we can have it work for us. Working with the teams to write the Process and Procedures that support the work that each department is done and documented.

BNC – BRIGHTON NC MACHINE CORPORATION.
Director Quality Assurance & Compliance 04/14/2014 to present
• Joined BNC to support Kevin Alder – President, CEO and 4 other new to the company Directors in saving the company from a failed corporate system that included a poorly built and executed Quality policy. Early January 2014 the company had lost their FORD business & Q1. ISO-9001 certification and was in the final weeks of losing Detroit Diesel business due to not just certifications but non-conforming material being found at the customers build locations in the US and Europe. MTU-America / MTU-FN reduced their material content with BNC 75% leaving only simple casting brackets and manifolds.
• April 14th 2014: began rebuilding the QA Dept. with a Protocol Standards of Ethics, assigning the 9 staff members to a job responsibilities metric system of PDCA. Each member was trained to work as a team and participated in team Internal/External workshops (i.e. MMTC) and first responder medical emergency unit certification. On the 16th of April 2014 I escalated an emergency ISO audit with American Systems Registrar to define the gaps in the current policy, failing the audit was a known prior result to define the needs and actions for the Board of Directors and the customers that were exiting the business. Directing my Team to start anew and build a system to carry the company to a viable and profitable organization that it had once been. Working with the key mid-level management directors and manager from DDC, Ford, Caterpillar and MTU the new Director team moved aggressively to work in our specific skill sets.

Training with all department managers and leaders and plant support personnel was aggressively undertaken, follow thru meeting on the progress was simultaneously ongoing with the customers building a positive belief that the business in jeopardy should not be removed with the efforts and a guarantee that BNC would regain our ISO certification by October 2014. Teamwork and support of the workforce @ BNC gave the company a return to a ISO certification in late June 2014.
• July 2014: Awarded new business from Caterpillar, FORD, Webasto and DDC. In part due to the training and execution of the systems and the belief we can do what was thought by many that our effort where in vain and we would fail. New business yielded a 8.7 million increase for 2014. Including a transfer program from a competitor supplier (MCI-Brighton) that went out of business with no warning to Caterpillar and MTU. BNC was able to react and meet the production needs due to the engagement of positive thinking and resilient teamwork we had brought and honestly believed in.
• August 2014: Training implemented for Advanced Quality System’s. Lead Auditor, Internal Systems Auditor, SPC & SharePoint Document Control. Core Tools with Yellow Belt training for Production, Operations leaders and Engineering staff. Focusing on the MRB system and the reduction of the monthly scrap that was over 780k in 2013. Town Hall quarterly meetings with all employees to build communication and strengthen the values for a successful operation that would be a completive manufacturer and making BNC a unique place to be employed at.
• July 2015: ISO/TS-16949 – ISO/9001-2005 Certification was awarded with the Advanced Quality planning training and systems installed and operational in all departments. Consecutive awards for 2016 & 2017
• August 2015: Ford Q1 – Service awards for R47F/EAOD Transmission Pump components and Assemblies, delivering FORD OEM quality certified product through the FORD Parts network for dealership/consumer use.
