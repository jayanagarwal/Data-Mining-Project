PROFILE
As a construction project manager and civil engineer with over three years of experience, I have a proven track record in project coordination, leadership, quality control, budgeting, and scheduling. My strengths lie in my strong organizational, development, implementation, communication, planning, and detail-oriented skills. I can effectively interface with clients from an execution perspective to manage timelines and budgets and have a keen understanding of complex business and financial concepts for evaluating and analyzing project performance. With my excellent leadership, communication, multi-tasking, and planning abilities, I have successfully executed drafting layouts, detail designs, and surveying for various civil construction projects. Additionally, my valid Real Estate License, knowledge of zoning bylaw, site plan, and official plan, and familiarity with ETABS, Auto Cad, MS Project, Revit, Primavera, and MS Office (Excel, Word, and PowerPoint) have equipped me with a diverse skill set. Furthermore, my experience in contract development, stakeholder relationship building, and fluency in French make me an asset to any team. WORK EXPERIENCE
