SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE
IT Specialist 02/2015 – 02/2016
Acting Technical Services Relationship Manager NIMH Bethesda, MD
Lead and re-enforced network security policy development projects designed to support such as Implementing Imation’s Iron Key Bio Drive system within the NIMH environment. Project plans were created for documenting each phase of the iron key console setup, and schedules were developed utilizing Microsoft Project to track all related tasks and resources. I conducted consultations with Imation to obtain cost analysis on a per license basis to provide Iron Key secure drives, and physical resources required to initialize the project. Milestones and deliverables were defined, documented, and submitted to all project stakeholders detailing necessary phases of the Iron Key Console. Once the console was complete, all findings were reported to the Senior Advisor to the NIMH Director. In addition, a post review document was created for submission to the NIMH CIO detailing project success.
Provided overall direction and coordination of all advanced hardware and software projects required to implement extremely complex operating systems, system control and monitoring programs, computer-based communication networks, database management systems.
Served as a project officer on IT service contracts and is responsible for providing operational management of contracts as well as, Advised NIMH Senior Management on best alternatives for the implementation of systems, procedures, and services.
Demonstrated extensive knowledge in resolving difficult customer support requests involving integration or configuration related issues and support systems involving a wide variety of different platforms, operating systems, applications, and desktop configurations. For example, related to the Microsoft Windows 10 upgrade, Microsoft’s SCCM console would not automatically join Windows 10 based machines to the NIH.gov domain.
Collaborated with HHS to upgrade the onsite Life Cycle station used to update and issue PIV cards. Throughout the process, I was not always able to find a representative that knew how to program the application, therefore, I contacted our local CIT HHS representative and request our individual site license info along with Deloitte's user management info. Once this information was obtained, I contacted the vendor "Deloitte" directly and spoke with the key software engineer for card management. After working with Deloitte over the course of a couple days, the Life-cycle station was back up and running. This application is crucial to the success of the local support staff's ability to update and issue PIV card certificate renewals and issuance of ALT admin cards.
Manage special projects that have a significant impact on the delivery of customer support services such as, collaborating and providing expertise to the Facilities Project Manager in upgrading the technology for all National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) conference rooms.

These efforts have directly impacted the NIMH organizational efficiency.
Conducted cost benefit analysis to evaluate specifications and features of new products such as the Microsoft Surface Pro 3, Dell 7200 Series Ultra Book and Apple iPad, to determine if they provided full functionality and security encryption as seen in standard issued laptops. The analysis concluded that the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 demonstrated full functionality of both Dell 7200 Series Ultra Book and Apple iPad and in turn eliminated the need for staff to maintain multiple mobile devices. Based on my recommendations NIMH leadership has added the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 to the standard user configuration of mobile options.
