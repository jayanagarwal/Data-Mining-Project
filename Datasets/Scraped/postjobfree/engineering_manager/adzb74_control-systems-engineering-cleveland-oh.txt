BACKGROUND

I am currently employed with Siemens Building Technologies. I am responsible for the building automation systems at the Anthony J. Celebrezze, Carl B. Stokes, and Metzenbaum Court House Buildings. I was employed with Optima Management LLC. My responsibilities included, but were not limited to, the implementation building automation and facility management at, 55 Public Square, One Cleveland Center, in downtown Cleveland, Thyssen Krupp Materials Group facility in Detroit Michigan and the 8787 Stemmons facility in Dallas Texas. I was employed by Hines Interests Limited Partnership property management and development group as a Lead Engineer from July of 1994 till October of 2011. My current responsibilities encompass developing integration of existing legacy control systems with current technologies. I am still integrating and updating control systems at all facilities as needed to maintain reliable building control and value to ownership and the Client. Prior to my tenure with Hines, I worked in the quality engineering lab department for the Synthetics Products Corporation from June of 1993 to January of 1994. While attending Cleveland State University, I was employed by the Avery Dennison Corporation as an intern. During my internship, I assisted production technicians and senior production engineers with development of confidential processes. These processes are currently used throughout the Avery Dennison Corporation today.
