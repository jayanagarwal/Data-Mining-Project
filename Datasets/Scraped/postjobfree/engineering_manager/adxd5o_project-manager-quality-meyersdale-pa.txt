1. TECHNICAL DEPTH
Mathematics Underlying the Design of Pneumatic Tires First and foremost authority on tire design characteristics, concepts and behaviors. Since being introduced to this work in 1982, the author has embraced these concepts derived by John Purdy. It was through a self directed, in-depth study of Purdy's work that first provided the author a thorough understanding and a unique insight to expand those concepts into practical solutions to common issues faced by both design and production.
Application of Purdy concepts by the author to computer systems for rapid, recursive solutions, has allowed the author to develop further technical depth of tire behavioral issues, such as:
- Dimensional delta under inflation
- Heat generation/dissipation
- Stress and fatigue analysis
- Component placement
- Cord angle / tension
- External loading
- Cavity shape
- Ply shear
- Epi / rivet
- Rho M
Application
- Evaluate fatigue mode for multiple MCT tire lines that were shown to have below minimum rivet. Developed model of existing materials for the tires behavioral flow of rubber from one area to another, resulting in non-uniform cured rivet, to show eventual solution
- Developed CAD program to display graphic representation of theoretical Purdy neutral ply line, based on simple OD, Rho M and cured ply angle input. Results allow for significantly improved cavity shape analysis to minimize cavity dimensional growth effects
- Developed model for revising cavity shape for MCT tire line with unacceptable dimensional growth. Solution would save existing hardware vs. cost for purchase of new molds
- Expand bead area fit models, derived from MCT solutions, to Large Rear Farm bead area concerns. MCT solution modeled on rim/bead ring configurations. LRF model successful to significantly reduce rim slip and bead area fatigue
- Continue expansion of bead area fit models from North America products to Asia MCT products. Results successful to significantly reduce bead area returns
- Develop CAD model to provide graphic display of 2 dimensional representations of the 3 dimensional interfaces of tread surface and non-skid surface for any Toroidal geometric shape. Results provide exact geometric surfaces to develop tire sections accurately. Page 8
- Developed model to calculate radial depth between tread surface and non-skid surface for any Toroidal shape. Result provides precise tire section models for plaster mold model carving
- Pioneered early development works on RMT product for optimizing tire wear characteristics. Tread gauge variation relative to tri-axial forces as measured by Fuji pressure sensitive footprint paper and tri-pin units, leading to optimized footprint shape and precise de-coupling groove location.
- Developed structural analysis to move the RMT focus from LRG to LRF for additional improvement in tire wear characteristics in dual applications.
- Developed test procedure to evaluate Farm Tractor "Lope" due to radial tire first harmonic
(R1H). Procedure included tire and rim R1H location, assembly R1H location to each other, vehicle speed and tire inflation. Results provided data for minimizing tire assembly R1H through modifications to factory processes, tire construction and vehicle tire assembly process.
- Developed test method at local focus account to evaluate "out of round" wear for RMT steer. Results provided data to refute assertions that specific vehicle mechanical combination may be the contributing factors.
- Pioneered methods of evaluating Heavy Truck vehicle alignment geometry without sophisticated electronic tools. Methods involved use of ruler, square, string, plumb, and compass.
- Act as instructor for Radial Truck & Farm Tire systems school for field sales engineers. 2. TECHNICAL BREADTH

4. BUSINESS AWARENESS
Goodyear’s principal business is the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of tires throughout the world. Our success in today’s environment of global competition is directly related to the quality of the products we provide. Domestic
One of the primary functions working with Truck and Farm products was to work closely with the Sales & Marketing Engineers in field applications. Many of the customer issues required the author to meet with the customer to understand needs and how best to provide the product or service that would meet those needs, and those of Goodyear. Integrating one of Goodyear’s primary business goals of “achieving complete customer satisfaction by offering the most advanced quality products through the most efficient distribution system, thereby providing superior performance”, the author developed his awareness of the business requirements of Goodyear on behalf of our customer, balancing such mutual needs as:
- Production capabilities
- Product performance
- Product delivery
- Product cost
Application of this business awareness has provided the author opportunities to be involved with developing and implementing new techniques or Technologies for improved product quality and customer satisfaction, such as:
Page 11
- Faster mold development
- CAD Torus modeling
- CAD Purdy cavity modeling
- Product performance
- Vehicle alignment techniques
- Decoupling groove location
- RMT load range F for dual application
- RMT optimized footprint wear analysis
- Eliminating Wild Bead Wires
- Radial LRF uniformity
- Product cost improvements and Product line rationalizations
- Consumer
- RMT
- BMT, BLT
- Farm
International
Additionally, the author has developed international business experience, implementing domestic business awareness where applicable.
Perhaps the single, most significant business impact Goodyear has undertaken is the new global alliance currently being established with Sumitomo/Dunlop, providing Goodyear with access to world wide markets previously unavailable such as Japanese OE, Canada, Mexico and European replacement. Additional strategic advantages will come from the merging of these world class technology groups which will drive Goodyear rubber technologies to greater levels yet unseen. Experience with the Global International business arena continues to provide the author a unique opportunity to further his understanding of the business effects, not only for domestic issues, but also from the bigger, global impact. We are more frequently faced with issues that cannot be defined or resolved by applying "domestic" solutions. These business issues are typically associated with the fragile Asian and Latin American economies that have experienced huge volatility recently. An out-cropping of this instability in Asia has been the gradual erosion of the destructive tariff walls Asian countries had built around themselves. These tariff walls were significant roadblocks toward business growth for Goodyear. As these walls are falling, business opportunities for Goodyear Asia are exploding. Most significant is the move to source product from any country, in conjunction with the regions local monetary values and raw material availability. Yet primary for the ability to regionally outsource, is the construction rationalization that removes the local differences and provides singular commonality.
Additional evidence of this business understanding includes the author's work related to India's Page 12
South Asia Tyre joint venture dissolution with Ceat. As a direct result of this dissolution, the Aurangabad plant has a potential unacceptable tonnage loss of 50% by 12/99. However, along with this potential loss comes a significant business opportunity for Goodyear to enter a new market. The author is heavily involved with the implementation of those new product lines to avert such a catastrophic business loss.

- Managing the Product Offtakes with:
- China: Triangle Linglong Hangzhou BCT
- Thailand: Deestone Vee Rubber
- Mexico: Tornel
- India: Ralco
5. PROBLEM SOLVING ABILITY
From the many varied positions the author has held, the fundamental ability for effective problem solving has been a paramount requirement. Perhaps the best example of this was the author's contribution to the reduction of Radial 1
st
Harmonic (R1H) for Radial Rear Farm tires while on assignment in Freeport, Ill. This required the author to initiate an in-depth study of the two major influencing factors:
- Customer Vehicle and Assembly Dynamics
- Tire Plant Production Process Capability
The solutions came from sharing test data with the customer for improvements in both the vehicle tire assembly process, and from modifications in the tire production and materials handling processes. The tire process improvements were implemented as a direct result of the author's ability to assess the unique interaction of vehicle and tire assembly, allowing him to understand how the tire influenced vehicle lope, thereby initiating alternate production processes, such as:
- Component placement on building equipment
- Green tire storage
- Bladder life
- Mold effects
Through many waveform studies, implementation of the above resulted in Plant Production R1H Capability (PPC) improvement from 51% to 99%, and plant tire line average R1H reduced from 0.155 to 0.067. Statistical predictions on tire ride comfort were accurately modeled by the author from self developed test procedures at San Angelo proving grounds, to show the limits of PPC relative to customer assembly threshold capabilities. These predictions were used to successfully show significant improvement for customer acceptance of tire plant process improvements and for customer assembly improvements. (Ref. Appendix B documentation).

7. CONTRIBUTIONS WITH PRACTICAL SIGNIFIGANCE
Page 15
- Implement programming and practical application of CAD Torus 3D surface representations. Result provides instantaneous output to define groove cross sections with absolute precision. Initial program developed for use on tractor tires, but is applicable to any Torus geometric shape.
- Developed model for precise calculation to define Non-Skid depth along its normal line to the tread surface. This provided absolute definition for model carving depths, previously only estimated.
- Pioneered water based Teflon mold coatings for Radial Farm molds in 1995 to minimize cured tire waste and repairs. Results allowed the removal of the brittle, baked on plasma Teflon coatings for significant reduction in mold coating costs and cured tire repairs. Practice continues in use today.
- Pioneered techniques to measure/define truck and trailer geometry alignments using simple tools available to anyone. Tools included string, plumb bob, 3 feet of PVC pipe and 100' tape measure. This provided a very inexpensive means to monitor tire wear characteristics at dealer fleets. The techniques were subject to Technology Transfer to corporate Sales Engineers at the ITTS training seminars, and to large dealer fleets as requested by Sales and Marketing. Result showed significant improvement in tire wear characteristics without the need for high cost electronic alignment systems. Adding only two weigh scales and camber plates allowed for complete vehicle geometry checks. Techniques continue in use and field training today.
- Developed model to generate Purdy Neutral Ply Line for any cavity shape. Model uses CAD system for graphic overlay onto cavity. Can be used by any associate at any level of technical design competence. This model allows for immediate analysis of cavity shape for inflated dimensional characteristics. Model continues in use for cavity development.
