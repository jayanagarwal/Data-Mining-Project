EXPERIENCE
Technical Project Manager
Nikola February 2022 -June 2023, Phoenix, AZ
• Successfully introduced IGBT inverters from C-sample to Series production in our Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) for the US market.
• Lead weekly meetings with cross functional groups to define immediate corrective actions and resolve all issues reported by manufacturing and validation teams to obtain full performance and meet all functional safety requirements. 100% Functional Safety requirements achieved.
• Responsible to coordinate all engineering change requests for software and hardware updates defined by the engineering team at the lowest possible cost.
• Lead of SiC inverter launch for our Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) in US and EU markets, responsible to consolidate parts availability for Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Preseries and SOP builds. 100% parts availability on time.
• Managed engineering validations for inverters and brake resistor system components on B-Samples, C-Samples and D-Samples to assure all reported issues were properly addressed in the Design Validation Plans, all tests not completed on time tracked in a risk assessment and engineering validation sign off.
• Leader to obtain CARB zero emissions certifications for powertrain components in order to enable the possibility for our customers to be eligible for tax incentives by using BEV or FCEV trucks in their fleets. 100% of documentation delivered on time to CARB.
• Lead on-site workshops with component suppliers and engineering teams from powertrain, thermal, controls and functional safety to close any potential gap in terms of performance, cyber security or functional safety issues.
• Leading efforts to assure all components met the vehicle requirements for electromagnetic noise. 90% improvement with modification of high voltage architecture and software update.
• Leading supplier change project for brake resistor to obtain greater performance of power dissipation at lower cost, going from 65kW to 100kW at certain voltage with a reduction of 40% on production parts.
Liaison engineering manager
Daimler Trucks - Mexico November 2008 - January 2022, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico
• New product introduction to the assembly plant ahead of the program timelines defined at the corporate level by aligning design engineering, manufacturing engineering, supply chain and supplier strategies. 100% of projects incorporated in the plant's annual strategy.
• Coordinated multiple workshops at the plant to define clear objectives, processes and scope of each area, to create a collaborative environment with the assembly team, and reduce the number of issues found during the assembly process to reach similar level of defects per truck as the current product (DPU=3.5).
• Documented 100% of engineering issues found in a build round, and facilitated daily containment issues meetings with mechatronics, cab engineering and chassis engineering to define immediate containment actions and clean points, to prevent future issues.
• Led weekly call with engineering groups to define long term corrective actions and added those working plans to main timeline.
• Reduced the time to contain to 24 hrs or less and improved the distribution of issues Mechatronics (40%), Cab engineering (25%), Chassis engineering (30%) and other areas (5%), by reviewing the open issues and identifying areas for improvement, and working with engineering managers to implement the changes.
• As Liaison Engineering Manager, conducted weekly meetings at the plant level to inform progress and identify support needed from each area to remove blockers, with the main objective to maintain all departments well informed and fully aligned to immediate targets and long term goals.
• Leader of change over process, assuring material availability and kitted, build process defined at least one week before the change over, training for operators performed and documented before running the change, inspection process defined, Install diagrams and bill of materials content reviewed on time, CAD review at least 2 weeks before the change. These actions improved our on time delivery metric 80%.
• Technical lead on pilot trucks or customer visits, enhance of collaboration with maintenance fleet managers and national service managers to hear customer concerns or requests, then use that information and inform design engineering groups to full fill customer s expectations, then coordinate the implementation at the plant and inform clean points to our customers though the Quality assurance department or service organization.
• Responsible to analyze warranty claims reported from our dealers or customers and prioritize solutions based on safety risk, product liability, cost of repair and frequency of occurrence. 0.15 claims per truck.
PROJECTS
Launch of FCEV trucks for US
Nikola • February 2023 - Invalid date
•I lead saleable PPAP efforts for SiC inverters based on the completion of design validation plan and risk assessment.
• I developed specific Jira boards for each supplier to assure properly follow up and confidentiality.
• Managed different Jira boards to document, communicate across the organization and close all performance and safety functional issues. 60% of issues closed within 2 weeks.
• Implementation of cyber security features before SOP.
• Coordinate activities for Electromagnetic noise reduction in our brake resistor system from 250Vpp to 10Vpp by leading HV architecture changes and software updates at the controller level.
Supplier change for brake resistor
Nikola • February 2023 -June 2023
• Define in collaboration with powertrain engineering the duty cycles to be used by supplier to demonstrate durability of their component.
• Collaboration with Purchasing team to find out alternative suppliers with products already in production that meet power dissipation requested at same or lower cost, and found a supplier with an existing product 45% less expensive.
• Conduct weekly calls with the new supplier to inform about our major milestones in our timeline and agreed on validation testing to be done at end of July 2023.
• Thermal flow simulations done to evaluate the improvement of power dissipation with the new component, observed improvement from 65kW to 100kW.
• 4 different alternatives of thermal architecture evaluated to maximize the power dissipation of the new component one of them able to reach the maximum potential of the new component 141kW.
