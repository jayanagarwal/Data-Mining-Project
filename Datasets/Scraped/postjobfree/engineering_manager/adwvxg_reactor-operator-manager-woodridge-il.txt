SUMMARY: Over years of extensive experience in directing the Design and Implementation of Various Power Uprates at 15 Nuclear Units, Turbine Retrofit for 6 Nuclear units, Main Generator rewinds at 8 Nuclear units, along with managing at least 30 NRC inspections, 20 INPO evaluations (including 5 Industry Peers), Achieving INPO 1 and NRC Column 1 for Xcel plants in Policy Note 14, Root Cause Analysis, Self-Assessment and recovery efforts at various Nuclear plants
PROFESSIONAL Xcel Energy- Fleet Engineering Minneapolis, MN (August 2013- March 2021) EXPERIENCE: Sr. Director, Nuclear Engineering
Provided Governance and Oversight of the Engineering including Steam Generator Replacement at Prairie Island Unit 2 and Design and Implementation of Extended Power Uprate (EPU), including the Steam Dryer Issues at Monticello station. Developed and implemented a strategy to License Monticello for MELLLA+ as the first and only BWR in the country post EPU as well as credit for Containment Accident Pressure as the only EPU in the recent history On Special Assignment at Prairie Island for 16 months, managed station’s long standing Design Basis Analyses such as High Energy Line Break (HELB) and Direct Current (DC) models to demonstrate compliance with regulations and no operational risk. These efforts helped the station to exit Recovery and Policy Note 14 considerably faster than anticipated and best in the industry. Directed the implementation of the SAP and Standard Design Process across the fleet and concurrent with the industry
Exelon Nuclear – Corporate Engineering, Warrenville, IL (August 2008-August 2013) Senior Engineering Manager
Developed a Reactor Power Uprate strategy for the Exelon nuclear fleet to increase the Core Thermal Power by utilizing the existing margin within the Safety systems and those of the Power Train Components.
Established the infrastructure, including processes, procedures and the initial organization to undertake the multi Billion Dollar Reactor Power Uprate initiative. Managed the Design and Implementation of Power Uprates at LaSalle, Byron, Braidwood and Limerick Stations, including installation of Leading-Edge Flow Meters for Measurement Uncertainty Recapture
(MUR) Uprates
Managed and implemented two EPUs for the two units at Peach Bottom increasing the output by 17% for each unit at a cost of considerably less than $2000 per MW Lead the industry effort through Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) to develop a roadmap for Power Uprate which included Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) containing topics such as Steam Dryer Evaluation, Containment Accident Pressure, EPU Testing, etc. Mohammad Molaei

Exelon Nuclear – Corporate Engineering, Warrenville, IL (November 2003-August 2008) Engineering Manager
Developed design and procurement specifications, managed the implementation and monitored the post installation operation of 8 rewound Generator Stators and Rotors at Dresden, Quad Cities, Peach Bottom, LaSalle and TMI Stations
Developed Technical Specification for and negotiated the Technical terms with a European Turbine Manufacturer to retrofit 18 Low Pressure Rotors in 6 of the fleet nuclear units, with a net increase in generation of 240 MWe
As a member of Reactor Selection Committee, developed comparison of the Technical features of the new reactors (ESBWR and AP1000) for consideration by Exelon CNO Established a team of industry experts to assess the Extended Power Uprate vulnerabilities for Dresden and Quad Cities stations, post implementation of these Uprates. Exelon Nuclear - Dresden Nuclear Station, Morris, IL (March 1995-November 2003) Engineering Manager
As the Design Engineering Manager oversaw the design and implementation of EPU for the station including installation of High-Pressure Turbines and upgrade to BOP systems to accommodate a 17% increase in core thermal power. Coordinated the design and implementation with Qaud Cities station. The 4 Unit EPU was the most economically efficient power uprate in the Nuclear Industry As the Manager of the Engineering Programs for three years, managed implementation of significant improvements to the Reactor Vessel Internals, In Service Inspections and Testing, Motor Operated Valves, Air Operated Valves, Flow Accelerated Corrosion, Heat Exchangers, etc. Developed the charter, instituted the Engineering Rapid Response Team (ERRT) and managed the team at Dresden station, which became standard organization for Exelon in 1997. As an industry peer, participated in multiple Institute for Nuclear Power Operation (INPO) plant evaluations and assist visits, gaining a significant experience on industry practices. Attended and successfully completed the Senior Reactor Operator Certification training and gained a substantial knowledge of the plant design and operation in 1996. Established the Design Basis Initiative Team at Dresden in 1997, which lead to a comprehensive verification of the design and licensing commitments, as mandated by 10CFR50.54f. As the ERRT Supervisor, managed personnel and directed performance of Operability Determinations, Design of the plant Modifications, Temporary Alteration, Rigging, Shielding and equipment repairs. Directed large scale troubleshooting of equipment failure and causal analysis of significant plant transients and Mohammad Molaei
