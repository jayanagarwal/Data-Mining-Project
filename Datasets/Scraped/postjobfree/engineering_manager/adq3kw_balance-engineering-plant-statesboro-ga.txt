Dear: Hiring Manager

Please accept this letter and attached resume as an indication of my sincere interest in a challenging position at Edwards. I graduated in the Summer of 2010 with a degree in Industrial Management. With my degree and manufacturing experience, I feel I would be a strong asset for Edwards Place of Employment.

Obtaining my bachelor's degree at Georgia Southern University has given me a broad knowledge in manufacturing. My area of study concentrated on time management, lean manufacturing, cost engineering, and the responsibilities of a manufacturing and industrial manager. While there, I had extensive training in Six Sigma, which is a vital tool for today’s industries.

Even though I have over 10 years of managerial/supervisory experience from some reputable companies, most of my knowledge comes from Georgia Transformer Company. As a Production Superintendent, I understand the value of having great communication skills with the operators and managers. With my managerial skills, my department has increased productivity and is consistently producing quality components.

Additional information about my education and experience is included on the enclosed resume. If possible, I would like to meet with you at your convenience to discuss my potential for this position. If you have any more questions, please contact me at 912-***-****.

Sincerely,

Jamie L. Porter
