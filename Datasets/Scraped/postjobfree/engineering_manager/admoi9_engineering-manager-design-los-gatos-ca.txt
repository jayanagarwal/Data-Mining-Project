Sr. Software CAD Engineer
Texas Instruments (July 2011 – July 2013 (2 years 1 months) – Santa Clara, CA
Collaborated with R&D group to design, develop and QA the tool for transformer/inductor optimization and synthesis tool using mathematical equation based to calculate the inductance value given other physical parameters (i.e. metal width trace, metal spacing trace, and number of turns) and vice versa for fast turn-around prototyping, before running actual simulation. The tool was written in Python and Qt4 with graphs comparison for various results. o Environment -- Linux
o Language -- Python & PyQT4
Took over existing Memory Compiler software created by TI software team and collaborated with memory designers to enhance the tool to support additional EDA views (Mixed Signal Verilog, Cadence EPS for IR Drop analysis) for IC design digital tools flow. o Environment -- Linux
o Language -- C, Perl
o RDBMS -- MySQL
Software CAD Engineering Manager
National Semiconductor (August 1984 – July 2011 (26 years 10 months) – Santa Clara, CA
Collaborated with memory designers to design, architect and develop “Memory Compiler” software which has the capabilities to generate various design views, such as layout in GDS and Cadence CDB and OADB, Schematic, EPS, LEF, CDL Netlist, Datasheet, Liberty, Timing verilog, Milkyway, and interface to Synopsys P&R tool for verification o Environment -- Linux
o Language -- C, hiDB scripting (Internal language, similar to TCL) o Scripting – TK/Tcl, C shell (as top level user interface and invokes various programs between the flow)
Project leader to develop “Reticle Generation” system tool by collaborating with multiple fabrication sites and mask making group to define the specification, and worked with remote site software group to design, implement and QA the system which has the following capabilities:
o Creates scribe-line with and without test patterns according to each fab site's spec. o Creates optimum reticle with maximum number of dies with and without test pattern according to each fab site's spec.
o Creates optimum wafer map with maximum number of dies and less steps to maximize the stepper machine through put.
o Creates stepper job control deck that can be feed directly to the stepper machine. o Create Mask Order Form
o Using Sybase’s RDMBS as the back-bone database to store the data where the fab's operator can down load the information from.
o Environment -- Linux
o Language -- C, TCL/TK, C shell (to control the flow to invoke various EDA tools)
Project leader to develop “TapeOut Cockpit tool“ that run final verification flow (such as DRC, ERC, Soft-Check, LVS for both Cadence Assura and Synopsys Hercules tools) on a design before mask-making process, according to each process technology's verification flow to ensure the design is verified and meet technology design rules. The process design rule is provided by process design engineer and captured/stored in Oracle RDBMS.
Managed a team of CAD engineers to develop standard cell library characterization flow.
Managed a team of CAD engineers to develop front-end IO library cell checker. o Environment -- Linux
