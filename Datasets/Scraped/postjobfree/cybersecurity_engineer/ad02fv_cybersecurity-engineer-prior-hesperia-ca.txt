EXPERIENCE

COMBAT VEHICLE TECHNICIAN * UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS *
AUGUST 2014 - AUGUST 2018

While serving in the Marine Corps, I served as a primary
technician for the LAV amphibious platform both overseas, and
within the States. I conducted repairs on everything from diesel
and mechanical driveline systems, to integrated electronics, drive
motors, high-voltage systems, and automated/ computer-assisted
turret and ordnance systems, to name a few.

DIESEL REPAIR TECHNICIAN + PETERBILT/RUSH TRUCK CENTER *
AUG 2018 - FEB 2019

My first job upon separating honorably from the Marines, I was
a front-desk and estimate representative for a major trucking
repair facility located in East Los Angeles. I created commercial
estimates, communicated repairs, and mitigated customer
experience and concerns, while meeting labor, maintenance, and
repair deadlines with adherence to strict safety policies.

RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNICIAN JAN 2022-JUNE 2022

My most recent job, I worked as an engine-builder for
integrated generators, in which I would make repairs to internal
combustion engines paired to A/C generators, regulated by logic
controllers to create self-sustaining energy plots.
