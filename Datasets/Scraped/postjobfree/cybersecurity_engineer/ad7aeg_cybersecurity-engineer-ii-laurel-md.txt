CyberSecurity Engineer looking for position in a SOC or as a part of a CyberSecurity Team either local to my area, or in a remote/hybrid environment.
I am a very quick learner, and have experience in many of the commonly used tools in CyberSecurity, including SIEM tools, Right Management, Vulnerability Management, and User Rights Reviews as well as pen testing. I also did a great deal of monitoring of indexes in SPLUNK for any abnormal activity taking place outside normal operational hours developing queries to parse out activity by date and time. I believe with the wealth of exposure and knowledge I have picked up, I can make a very valuable addition to any Cybersecurity Team. Work Experience
