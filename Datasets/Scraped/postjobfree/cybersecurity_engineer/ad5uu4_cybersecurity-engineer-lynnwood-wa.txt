Research Experience
1. A Dual-Model Anomaly Detection Algorithm for non-linear stream data in Smart City Environments. Paper presented at the 5th International Workshop on Security and Reliability of IoT - DCOSS-IoT 2024, Abu Dhabi, UAE. Link to paper Description: This paper introduces a novel anomaly detection approach for smart cities, using a dual regression model system. The primary model generates accurate predictions, while the secondary model introduces controlled noise. Together, they detect outliers by comparing the alignment cost or Euclidean distance of actual traffic against the high-quality model’s predictions. This approach effectively identifies anomalies, particularly in defending against DoS and Flood- ing attacks, by setting a threshold based on these comparisons. Experimentation with various regression algorithms, including linear regression and support vector regression, demonstrated the method’s effectiveness, outperforming traditional models in smart city datasets. 2. Identifying Smart Strategies for Effective Agriculture Solution Using Data Mining Techniques. Hindawi, Journal of Food Quality. Link to publication Description: In this project, we used Data Mining Techniques (CART and random forest al- gorithms) to identify key factors that play a role in the development of crops in India so as to increase agricultural output. The Study was done with the help of some Universities in India that provided the dataset of local farms. The Data Mining process was done with R Studio, Matlab, and Scikit-Learn Repository.
3. Advantages of Machine Learning in Networking-Monitoring Systems to Size Network Appliances and Identify Incongruences in Data Networks. Trends in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Engineering. ICAETT 2021. Link to publication Description: We demonstrated two uses of Machine Learning (with Regression Algorithms) in Data Networks.
1. We used machine learning for planning and assignment of resources in network components, we demonstrated that it is easy to do this task as long as we have a good monitoring repository like Nagios(Dataset) and good machine learning algorithms. 2. We used machine learning to identify flood attacks (DOS, DDoS, etc.) in Data Networks (In- congruences), the project involved making ML algorithms to learn the normal traffic patterns in Data Networks and take decisions based on the anomalies that can be discovered. This project was done with private dataset and by using Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, and Scikit-Learn Repository.
4. Optimal Combination of Multivariate Filter Feature Selection and Classifier for Speech- Based Depression Detection. Artificial Intelligence Evolution. Link to publication Description: In this project, we made use of Multivariate filter features and Classification Ma- 2
chine Learning algorithms to detect depression in people based on their speech. We use public dataset for this purpose as well as Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook and, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn.
5. An Empirical Evaluation of Machine Learning for Hardening Security Devices in Data Networks. IEEE CHILECON 2021. Link to publication
Description:In this project, we have weighted the advantages of Machine Learning (Classifica- tion Algorithms) for Hardening Security Devices, we used ICAP protocol to download traffic from network security devices and be processed by Machine Learning Algorithms playing different cy- bersecurity roles. In this project, we developed different cybersecurity engines based on Machine Learning, like:
- IDS, IPS, and AntiDDoS Engines (For traffic like DNS, LDAP, MSsql, NetBios, NTP, UDP, etc).
- Antivirus engine to classify malign MD5 Hashes.
- URL filtering/Domain Filtering engine to classify malign and benign traffic.
- WAF engine/Reverse-proxy engine.
This project was done with private dataset(find in paper) and by using Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, and Scikit-Learn Repository. 6. A Novel Framework to Determine Micro-level Population Figures Using Spatially Dis- aggregated Population Estimates and Artificial Intelligence. Link to publication Description: This study done in tandem with the University of Lagos, Nigeria. We proposed a framework for aggregating population figures at micro levels within a larger geographic jurisdiction using high-resolution spatially disaggregated population data estimates. QGIS, Python program- ming language, and machine learning techniques were used for spatial and raster analysis, data visualization, and zonal statistics. Lagos Island, in Lagos, Nigeria was used as a case study to demonstrate how to calculate a more precise population estimate and resolve the ambiguity in population estimates arising from the use of antithetical parameters in the calculations. We also showed how the population data obtained can be used for estimating the carrying capacities of urban basic services such as healthcare, water, sanitary facilities, education, etc. The proposed framework would help urban planners and government agencies to plan and manage cities better using more accurate data.
7. Design of a V2V Communications Antenna Based on LTE Technology and IEEE802.11p Standard. IEEE INTERCON 2017. Link to publication
Description: In this project, we developed a microstrip antenna for V2V, LTE, and VANET Net- works, the antenna is able to perform well for all these technologies’ RF spectrums and offers the simplicity of being a small component. This projects was done by using HFSS software, Solidworks, and Matlab programming Language, as well as, after the construction, it was tested with several RF devices.

UW Bothell – Seasonal Researcher
Bamberg, Germany (06/2023 to 08/2023)
Part of the research cohort of the University of Washington, Bothell at the University of Bamberg(Otto- Friedrich-University Bamberg).
Functions:
Research and development of software solutions for smart cities, cybersecurity, etc. Research cohort led by Prof. Brent Lagesse, Ph.D.
- One notable aspect of my work involved spearheading the development of Anomaly Detection Al- gorithms aimed at preempting injection attacks, including but not limited to SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and command injection. In pursuit of this objective, I leveraged Machine Learning Algorithms dedicated to anomaly detection, such as the Isolation Forest, One-class Support Vector Ma- chine (SVM), and autoencoders.
- Additionally, I undertook the creation of an innovative methodology designed to identify anomalies within streaming data. This methodology has the potential to significantly enhance our capability to detect flooding attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) incidents, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) at- tacks, and a combination of Times Series and Non-Linear problems in general. This proposed approach advocates the utilization of regression algorithms for establishing a threshold value. This threshold is established through pattern recognition techniques, including Alignment Cost and Euclidean Distance, which facilitates the evaluation of incoming network traffic. By analyzing the corresponding Alignment Cost (AC) or Euclidean Distance (EC) and comparing it against expected spectrums, anomalies are promptly identified.
