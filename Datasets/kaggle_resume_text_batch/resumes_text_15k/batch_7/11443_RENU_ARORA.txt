Role of KMP-11 antigen exposed Dendritic cells in 
modulation of signal transduction function and immunity 
during Visceral Leishmaniasis.
KMP-11 ( Kinetoplast if membrane protein-11) is 
surface protein of a parasite Leishmania donovani, which is 
responsible for the causation of Visceral leishmaniasis 
(VL). To design a vaccine against VL, dendritic cells as 
antigen presentating cells were used. Cytokines (IL-10, IL-
12, IFN - gamma,etc ) release profile of KMP-11 primed DCs 
was assessed.
