BTECH –PROJECT


· Title  Optimization of microstrip patch antenna using Particle swarm optimization with curve fitting
· Details

· An optimization technique for microstrip patch antenna using particle swarm optimization (PSO) with curve fitting will introduced in this project. An inverted E-shaped microstrip patch antenna designed for IMT-2000 band is utilized to demonstrate the optimization technique. The data for curve fitting is obtained from Zealand IE3D software by varying different geometrical parameters of the antenna. Using the data, the equations representing the relationship among different parameters of a microstrip antenna are generated. Graphmatica curve fitting software was used to generate the curve. The PSO program was developed and executed in MATLAB and finally the optimized antenna was simulated in Zealand IE3D. Comparison between conventional antenna and curve fitting based PSO  optimized antenna showed remarkable improvement over bandwidth. For the inverted E-shaped microstrip patch antenna, the bandwidth increased by 15%.
