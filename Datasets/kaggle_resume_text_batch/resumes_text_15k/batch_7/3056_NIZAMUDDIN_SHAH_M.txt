PROJECT HANDLED

Project Name: ”PARALLEL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS”                     
Team size      :
 4
I worked on the project “Parallel Infrastructure for Distributed Applications using HADOOP”, where terabytes of data managed, searched and retrieved efficiently with less time and memory. 

HADOOP is an open source framework maintained by apache group, which is very useful for large distributed applications, which enables us to work with terabytes of data.

We installed HADOOP on 4 UBUNTU LINUX   machines, both as single node and multi node, with the use of SSH and jdk1.6.

We ran word count application for a huge text file and compared the total time taken by both single and multi node. 

My project team is a group of four which is lead by me .Further development in our project will be done by our juniors.
