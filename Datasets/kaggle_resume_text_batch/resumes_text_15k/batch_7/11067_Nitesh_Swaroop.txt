ACADEMIC THESIS 

 
Project Title:        “Reducing Delhi Transport Corporation Buses Breakdown by Employing 
        Better Maintenance Schedule” 
Description:      The objective function is made of two components. The first is catalysing a  
       weighted total maintenance hours (maintenance utility) for the buses that were 
       pulled for maintenance during idle time, and the second is minimizing the  
       weighted total number of maintenance hours for the buses that are pulled out of 



       their scheduled service for inspection. Mixed-integer linear programming solver 
       of MATLAB has been used to solve the defined problem. The solution to this 
       problem gives the maintenance schedule for each bus that is due for inspection as 
       well as the minimum number of maintenance lines that should be allocated for 
       each type of inspection over the scheduled period. Proportional Hazard Model 
       (PHM) is used to evaluate the effect of covariates on critical component failure 
      and predict the failure mileage of critical components. Determined the optimum 
      time of Preventive Replacement by using Age Replacement Model & Weibull++. 
      Finally an app was developed on Matlab which is used to generate maintenance 

      schedule for all the buses in a depot. 
 
ACADEMIC PROJECT 

 
 Submitted project on – Stirling Engine, designed and built a working model of the same in the session of 2012 - 2013 

o Obtained useful mechanical work output from a heat input by employing a stirling cycle engine mechanism and 
increased its efficiency by using regenerator 

 Submitted a project on  - Maruti Suzuki India Limited wherein analysed the application of Just In Time through industrial 
visit of 1 day at the unit in 2015  
o Prepared a report on how the Just In Time application has been adopted by the organization to achieve higher 

operational efficiency and to reduce the inventory carrying cost
