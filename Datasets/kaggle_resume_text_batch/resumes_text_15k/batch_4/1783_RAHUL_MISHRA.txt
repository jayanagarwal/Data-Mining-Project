CAREER OBJECTIVE 
 

“One cannot teach an employee how to smile. They have to smile before we hire them.” – LinkedIn  
The above phase, made me introspect; what should be an ideal objective of any HR professional – to build an organization where 
everybody is valued, respected and motivated to come to work every day. Thus, I wish to be associated with an organization where I can 
– learn the science & art to build such Great Places to Work.   
 
What I bring to the table apart from mundane tasks – bias for action, strong work ethic & desire to achieve excellence
