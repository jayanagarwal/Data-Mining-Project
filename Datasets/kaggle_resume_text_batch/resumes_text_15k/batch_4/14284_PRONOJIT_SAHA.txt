WORK EXPERIENCE 
Position:             Senior Data Scientist, Usha Martin Technologies            Duration: February ’16 – Present 
Leading small teams, doing presales, architecting end-to-end ML-driven products and getting them live into production.  
Projects: 

Business Problem  Solution  Result 
Client (cpg manufacturer) 
wanted to have a better 
control over the quality of its 
products. 

Build predictive models for triangulating process 
patterns leading to anomalous values in output, 
using random forests and gradient boosting 
algorithms. Added a prescriptive step using 
bayesian optimization providing best combination 
of input process parameters. 

Model deployed into production using 
docker containers. The model led to 
increase in the proportion of products 
produced within the desired quality 
range by 72% in a 3-month trial phase. 

Above cpg manufacturer 
wanted to have a real-time 
implementation of the model. 

Designed the end-to-end data pipeline and 
technical architecture. Used Kafka, Spark 
Streaming, Spark ML, Hbase, node.js. 

Client gets alerted in real time before a 
process goes out of bounds, hence 
saving lot of overheads and costs. 

Client (utility company) 
wanted to have better energy 
demand forecasts to achieve 
better balance between 
demand and supply. 

Used time series techniques like ARIMA & 
LSTM to model the data. Engineered new 
temporal features based on data. Final model 
employed 2-layer stacked LSTM using 
tensorflow and keras. 

The model generated robust 
predictions with a final RMSE that 
was 5 times less than the previous 
models employed by the client. 

Position:           Data Scientist, Independent Consultant                   Duration: January ’12 – January ’16 
Worked in small teams and executed 8 projects solving business problems utilizing predictive & text analytics.  
Projects:    

Business Problem  Solution  Result 
Client (cpg manufacturer) 
wanted to predict machine 
failures in advance to solve 
the issue of production loss 

Set up a supervised anomaly detection 
framework. Built ML models addressing extreme 
class imbalance and implemented final model in a 
real-time architecture using kafka, spark, Hbase. 

In 2 months of pilot client had only 2 
failures that went undetected. Thus, 
capacity utilization went up by 12% 
and more costs saved in repairing. 

Client wanted an internal 
chatbot to handle employee 
queries pertaining to its HR 
practice. 

Built a HR domain transactional chatbot. Applied 
NLP techniques to pre-process user queries. 
Utilized word2vec deep-learning model pre-
trained on google news corpus to generate word 
embeddings and resolve user queries. 

The chatbot was deployed as a flask 
app in a pilot run of 3 months and 83% 
correct query resolution was achieved. 

Client (financial sector) had a 
requirement of improving its 
marketing campaign to attract 
HNI customers. 

Build a predictive model to segment potential 
customers using ensemble of gradient boosting 
and random forest classifiers. 

Client improved it’s marketing ROI by 
35% based on predicted segmentation, 
in the 6 months of implementation. 

Client (online platform) 
wanted to reduce marketing 
costs in reaching out to 
exhibition booth workers. 

Built a predictive model to predict the attendance 
of exhibition booth staffs using gradient boosting 
algorithm by modeling their behavioral and social 
media attributes.  

A web app was built using Flask for 
the final production model. The 
client’s conversion rates improved by 
around 205%.   

Client (financial sector) was 
facing issue of low lead 
conversion ratios. 

Build a predictive model to predicted the loan 
disbursal probability of the leads using gradient 
boosting algorithm. 

High conversion probabilities leads 
were targeted leading to increase in 
conversion ratios by 26%.
