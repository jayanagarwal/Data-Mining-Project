Shaadi.com (ReactJS development) -
Description: Web-based interactive application. Currently working on this project. I am responsible for building the front end using ReactJS. I consume data from Node APIs provided by respective team. 

The workflow involves following Test Driven Development using Jest. I write test cases covering major business rules which results in less probability of errors & faster delivery of the modules. I am using Redux architecture in current project & well versed with the technicalities of redux & concepts in react.
For writing CSS I use styled components which gives me more control over individual components. This is helpful for faster changes in any component without breaking other part of the code, reducing dev cycles & test cycles.
