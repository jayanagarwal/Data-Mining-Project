ACADEMIC PROJECT: 
 

 

Name : RFID BASED NATIONAL CARD /PASSPORT  SYSTEM 
 

Duration : 2 Months 

TeamSize :  4 

 

DESCRIPTION: 
                       The project is aimed to design a RFID based passport system, which adds more security and easy 

authentication compared to the conventional passport book. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Card Readers provide a low-cost 

solution to read passive RFID transponder tags up to 2 inches away. The RFID Card Readers can be used in a wide variety of 

hobbyist and commercial applications, including access control, automatic identification, robotics navigation, inventory tracking, 

payment systems, and car immobilization. This project is designed on  8051 micro controller, in this project along with the hardcopy 

passport book, we also include an RFID card, which is unique for each passport, this RFID card holds the details of the passport like 

the name , gender and other details of passport in an electronic memory format, using this system we can eliminate the fake passport 

books, when the book is shown to the reader the information present in the card is read by the reader and displayed in to the LCD 

connected to the microcontroller
