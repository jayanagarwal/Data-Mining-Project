OBJECTIVE                          : I want to step into the corporate world and want to see myself in a reputed       organization.

After stepping into the corporate world, I want to acquire first hand     knowledge of how an organization runs. Ten years down the line I want to see me in a managerial position where I would take strategic decisions. I would like to be an asset for my organization.

Around this time I would know whether I have the capability to branch out   of my own. “Service to man is service to God” would be the main factor of my activities. I would decide the area of my work in the future.
