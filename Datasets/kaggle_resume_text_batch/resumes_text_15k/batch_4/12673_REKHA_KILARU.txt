Title of the project: RS9116 microcontroller Firmware Development (IoT Platform) 

Description: The purpose of RS9116 product is to provide a good platform for Internet of-Things (IoT) 

applications. The platform consists of Redpine Signals RS9113 Wi-Fi 802.11bgn module, ARM Cortex M4 

processor.   

My role of project is to develop firmware and validate the peripherals of MCU 

• Implemented API’s for serial communication interfaces like I2C, I2S, UART, SPI, Quad SPI. 

• Implemented API’s for peripherals like PWM, Quadrature Encoder Interface, TIMERS , FIMQ and 

DMA. 

• Testing and bug fixing of peripherals and validation of peripherals on FPGA. 

• Implemented flash algorithm for various development environments like Keil , CoIDE and IAR 

Workbench. 

• Created startup code and header files for the new microcontroller device based on CMSIS 

standards 

• New MCU device support for development tools like Keil and IAR Workbench. 

• Documented all the firmware development steps according to standards. 

• Implemented CMSIS Drivers for I2C ,Ethernet and I2S peripherals to port various MCU vendor 
applications easily. 

 

Title of the project: Video Streaming with OV788 kit 
Description: To capture video from camera module of OV788, stores the raw data in server and stream 

it through RS9113 WiFi module. 

My responsibility of the project is bring up SPI communication between OV788 and Cortex-M4 based 

microcontroller (WiseMCU). 

• Implementation of SIF protocol of OV788 board 

• Application implementation for SPI communication on WiseMCU. 

• Debugging and Integrating the firmware. 

• Captured video stream from OV788 board camera module successfully. 
 

Title of the project: Sensored BLDC Motor Control Application using PWM module 

Description: RS9116 has six PWM outputs that can be driven with PWM signal. The MCPWM module 

has been designed specifically for motor control applications. The important feature of the MCPWM 

used in this application is the Override Control and immediate duty cycle update. 

• Implementation of PWM application to run motor in clockwise or anti clockwise.  

• Generating desired motor speed by reading Hall sensors . 

• Analysing shaft direction and position and velocity with QEI. 

• Testing , bug fixing  and documentation. 
 

Title of the project : I2S Audio Application Development using Freescale’s SGTL5000EVB 

Description: SGTL5000 is a Low Power Stereo Codec with Headphone Amp from Freescale. This EVB is 

configured as I2S master to provide 3.12Mhz clock to the RS9116 I2S slave module. This application will 

sent audio data from slave to master and master module plays this audio using stereo codec. 

• Configuring  stereo codec control software for required master clock 

• Created initialization script to program registers of SGTL5000 

• Implemented code to transmit audio data from slave to master. 

• Testing , bug fixing  and documentation.
