WORK EXPERIENCE 
Royal Bank of Scotland – Senior Risk Analyst (June 2015 – Present)  
 
Some of the key projects included: 

 IFRS9 Model Development(Chain ladder method and logistic regression) 
 Chain Ladder Method 

This model involved estimation of lifetime PDs through the extrapolation of cumulative 
default curves till the end of lifetime using Chain ladder method (CLM) 
Performed time on book and default maturity analysis to find lifetime of mortgage 
portfolio 
Using CLM, quarterly cumulative default rates were extrapolated for each vintage and 
weighted average by volume was then used to capture overall cumulative default rate 
Applied forward looking factors to arrive at final lifetime PD values for each vintage 
Performed back book one-off calculation to generate the PD values at the time of 
acquisition  

 
 Logistic Regression model for PD calculation 

The project was aimed to determine probability of default for mortgages which involved:  
Data extraction, cleaning, outlier and missing value treatment  
Removing multi co linearity and variable selection using IV, VIF and clustering analysis 
Regressing the final variables to develop a logistic model for PD calculation  
Validating the model on validation dataset and out of time sample 

 
 Scorecard Reviews 

 Reviewed and revised scorecard cut-offs for decline, approval and refer of mortgage 
applications 

 Review of multiple cut-offs were taken basis riskiness of the customers, before assigning 
the new cut-offs 

 
 LGD Provisions Model 

 The model was segregated into two stages - In Stage1, multinomial logistic approach was   
employed to generate probabilities of 4 outcomes given default  

 In Stage2, macroeconomic factors were applied and loss given outcome was recognized 
followed by the generation of LGD  
 

 Pre-Emptive Strategy  
 Developing strategy for non-delinquent retail customers 
 Designed contact and holdout population to measure the performance  
 Identifying the plausible reason for their default, and enhancing the champion strategy
