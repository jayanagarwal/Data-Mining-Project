PROJECTS

· Capgemini Technology Services India Ltd.

1. Incident classification using NLP and Clustering
· To classify large number of Service now incident tickets reported by users. 
· This was done to analyse which applications are facing issues frequently and to group the ticket based on the issues reported
· This analysis had helped to identify those applications and review their code and data flow to reduce future the incidents 
· Resulted in client money saving and reduced incident counts
Algorithm used: K-means Clustering
2. Email Request Classification
· Classifying email (body) data into types of access requests (Address Change, Access Grant, Access Remove etc.)
· Extracting entities like user name, user id, email, address, start date, end date, type of request, type of access to be given/revoked
Algorithm used: Entity Recognition
3. Predicting server failure using log files
· Analysing log files for server failure, time stamp, geographical region, memory, number of transaction, CUP utilization, number of processing running etc. 
· Used anomaly detection to predict server failure
Algorithm used: SVM
4. Credit Card Defaulter prediction
· Online available dataset for credit card defaulters was used to predict for defaulter prediction
· XGB classifier and Random forest was used feature selection
Algorithm used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGB classifier

5. Web portal development using Flask framework
· Built web portal using Flask framework, HTML 5, CSS3, AJAX, Apache, Java Script
· All the POCs build by team were activated on portal
· Machine learning models built by team we deployed to allow user to learn, download and test prebuilt models using their own datasets

6. ChatBot to automate Service Desk Tasks
· Built a chatbot using Kore.ai for application 
· Performing health check monitoring, restarting application, checking user access, providing extract form database by executing SQL queries, logging request into service now, updating database entries
Tools/Platforms: Kore.ai, Jenkins, eyeShare, Service Now 
7. Chatbot to provide team services and capabilities
· Built audio and text based agent using Google Dialog Flow platform
· Agent is able to provide information about team services and its capabilities using natural language process to understand used audio input and provide information in simple language format
Tools/Platforms: Google Dialog Flow, Google Home device
· Personal Practice Projects:
1. Sentiment analysis for audio data
· Used speech_recognition library from Google to convert audio data into text
· Used python’s NLTK library to perform text processing
· Stopwords removal, tokenizer, Bag of words and TF-IDF was used to convert the textual data into numeric vectors
Algorithm used: Naive Bayes
2. Stock Market price prediction
· Basic time series was done to identify increase/ decrease in future stock value
· ARIMA model was used to predict nifty stock price for next 30 days
Algorithm used: ARIMA
ACTIVITIES/INVOLVEMENTS

· Winner of Fintech Hackathon - 2 organized by GreyAtom School of Data Science
· Created automated jobs to minimize manual processing during critical month end activities which saved client money
· Received certificate of appreciation for completing data fix tasks in less than expected time
