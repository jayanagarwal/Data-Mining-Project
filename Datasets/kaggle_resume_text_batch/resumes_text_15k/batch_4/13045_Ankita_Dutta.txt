Projects  

 Project Title: Improvement of Private Brand Awareness  
 Location: Shoppers Stop, Velachery  
 
 Project Summary:  In this ever-competitive market, multi brand retailers are always in the look out to 

rather maintain a stable and sustainable more than increasing in steep risky slope. In doing so, they have 

been focusing more into increasing the sales of their in house brands, which they have been finding 

difficult due to the lack of awareness of the same among the target mass. My role as a trainee in Shoppers 

Stop had been to find ways by virtue of well-equipped market research techniques viz. Questionnaire 

designing, on store survey, online survey etc. to improve the awareness of private label brands in 

women’s' western wear section at Shoppers Stop.    

 Project Title: Competitor analysis of products, customer awareness and satisfaction level 

 Location: All leading multi-brand apparels retail outlets  

 Project Summary: Taking trail of the summer internship project, it appeared to me that an analysis 
regarding the competition analysis among all leading multi-brand retail outlets should be done with 

respect to products, customer awareness and satisfaction level should and must follow the previous 

project. Hence, I took up the project to conduct a thorough market research among the consumer mass to 

gauge their perspective concerning the above-mentioned parameters.
