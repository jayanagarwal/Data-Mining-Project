SEMINAR & PROJECT SUMMERY :


1. BE Third Year Seminar
Title: “ OPTICAL COMMUNICATION ”
Introduction: Optical communication is communication at a distance using light to carry the
                         information. An optical communication system uses a transmitter, which encodes
                         a  message into an optical signal or a channel. The transmitters in optical fiber links
                         are generally  light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or laser diodes. Infrared light is mostly
                       used because optical fiber transmits infrared wavelengths with less attenuation.
