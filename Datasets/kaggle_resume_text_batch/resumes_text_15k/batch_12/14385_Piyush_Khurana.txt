Gender Voice Speech Recognition using Machine Learning 

 Projects aims of determining a person’s gender as male or female based upon the sample of their voice. 

 This is achieved by designing a python program using Machine Learning Classification algorithms – Naive Bayes, 

SVM, Randomforest, XGBoost for acoustic analysis of voice or speech parameters for determining gender. 

 

T E C H N I C A L  S K I L L S  

 Languages : Python, R programing(statistical analysis), Core java, Django(basics), Hive 

 NLP Packages: NLTK, StanfordNLP, Spacy, TextBlob 

 Machine Learning libraries: SIF(smooth inverse frequency) Implementation, Scikit-learn, Gensim -(LSI&LDA), 

Tensorflow (basics), RASA NLU, WMD(Word Mover Distance using trained word embeddings model), FastText. 

 DataBases : Apache Solr, MongoDB, MySql, Redis, Whoosh 

 Excellent capacity to learn, adapt new tools & technologies.
