A. Machine Learning/Big Data analytics –  
 

‘Defining Auto Custody Limits using Random Forrest and Ensemble Modeling ’ 
Tags: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging Learners, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Big 
Data Analytics, H2O, SPARK, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, TensorFlow 

 Implemented data mining and statistical machine learning techniques to the existing method of defining custody limits for client 
accounts to model a more dynamic method of defining auto custody limits based on accounts’ borrowers rating, previous day’s 
Asset Under Custody(AUC) and historical limit usage behavior 

 Developed Supervised Learning models such as decision trees and random forest in Python to classify accounts into pre-defined 
risk categories and identify optimal rule based credit limit for bank’s customers resulting  

 Used Hadoop Framework solutions including HDFS, HIVE,  SQOOP  and big data processing engine SPARK to build predictive 
analytics on the data using PYTHON and ZEPPELIN as statistical analysis tool 

 This led to significant reduction in liquid cash maintenance from $1.3trillion to $700 billion

‘Client Attrition Analytics using Support Vector Machines ’  
Tags: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Big Data Analytics, Resampling Techniques  

 Investigated the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines (SVM) approach in detecting the underlying data pattern for the 
Treasury Services customer churn analysis and benchmarked its performance with other non-linear classifications rule learners 
on F1 Scores 

 Learnt non-linear classifiers from labelled training data belonging to client billing information – such as revenue, services and 
volume to predict client attrition score 

 Addressed the challenge of building a classifier on highly skewed data with very few attrition events (just 0.1% of attrition) 
using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) methodology. Application of SMOTE methodology along with SVM 
approach improved the accuracy of the model drastically
