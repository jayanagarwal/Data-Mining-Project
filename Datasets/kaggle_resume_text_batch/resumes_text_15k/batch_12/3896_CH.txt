ACADEMIC PROJECTS

Mini Project:

Project Name   
 : SPEECH CODING IMPLEMENTED BY USING SUB​​_BAND CODERS
Role


 : Team Member
Language/Tools Used : MATLAB
Duration

 : two Months

Team Size

 : 5
DESCRIPTION: The main aim of the project is to reduce the noise of a signal. Sub-band coders plays major role in this project. Sub-band coders split the signal into number of  segments,  each segment is coded separately using sub-band technique. After coding all coded segments are Combined. It can be done in the MAT LAB The prototype of the system is designed successfully. 
Main Project:                                                                                                                             Project Name
