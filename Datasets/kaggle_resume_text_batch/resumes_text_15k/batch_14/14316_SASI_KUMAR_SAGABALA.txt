 Preparing Test conditions and Test cases by understanding ETL mapping document. 

 Analysing the Informatica workflow’s transformation mappings to prepare test data. 

 Validating the transformations against functional requirements using test data. 

 Executing the test cases by running the workflows and debugging the issues found. 

 Raising the defects for valid issues, re-test those after fix and get it to closer. 

 Querying the database to check the data movement from source to target by doing Structure 

check, Record count check, Data Validation and Transformation check. 

 My responsibilities in Data Migration testing: 

 Creating the automated test scripts in Informatica DVO.
