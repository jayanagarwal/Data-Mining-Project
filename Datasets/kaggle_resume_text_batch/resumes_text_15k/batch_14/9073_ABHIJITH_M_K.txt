WORK EXPERIENCE 

DURATION DESIGNATION ORGANISATION 

April 21, 2016 - June 20, 2017 Project Assistant Level III CSIR-NAL Bangalore 

Oct 05, 2015 - April 04, 2016 Project Scientist NALTECH, NAL Bangalore 

Oct 17, 2014 - Sep 30, 2015 Project Assistant Level III CSIR-NAL Bangalore 

 

Division  : Modeling and Identification Group, Flight Mechanics and Control Division. 

Duration   : 2 Years & 7 months. 

Project Details :1) Flight validation and update of Aero database using System Identification 

   techniques for different variants of Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). 

2) Stability and Control characterization of Mirage-2000 for Store clearance. 

 

Responsibilities: 

 

 Fixed-Wing Aircrafts 
 

 Assisting Flight Monitoring and Envelope Expansion 

 Design of pilot input commands for PID data gathering through simulation. 
 Generation of Parameter Excursion Boundaries (PEBs) to assist real-time flight 

monitoring for flight safety. 

 Identification of the excursions adequacy in the flight parameters during real-
time flight monitoring for PID test points.

 Flight Data Segmentation and Database Management 

 Identification of the specific PID data segments in the flight data and 
segmentation. 

 Creation of a look-up database for the data segments to support the easily 
fetching of segments at any point of time for any configuration or specific 

conditions.  

 

 Flight Path Reconstruction 
 Accuracy of the identified model directly depends on the flight data.  
 Estimation of the sensors’ systematic errors, which in turn, will be used for 

sensor calibration. 

 Flight parameters are reconstructed from the body acceleration and the angular 
rates. 

 Estimation Methods: Output Error Method, Extended Kalman Filter. 
 

 Aerodynamic Database Validation and Update 

 Update to the baseline aerodynamic database from flight data using incremental 
delta model via Coefficient Level Matching approach. 

 Validation of the updated aerodynamic database is carried out through closed-
loop 6-DOF simulation. 

 Estimation Method: Equation Error Method, Recursive Least Squares. 
 

 Flight Performance Evaluation 

 Estimation of drag polar from the flight data. 
 Estimation of CD0. 

 

 Rotary-Wing Aircrafts (Helicopters) 

 Estimation of stability and control derivatives for Control LAW development. 

 Time Domain Analysis 

Rigid body and explicit models are implemented along with parameter 

estimation technique (Output Error Method) to extract the stability and control 

derivatives. 

 Frequency Domain Analysis 

Rigid body model is implemented in frequency domain using CIFER software, 

Stability and Control derivatives are extracted.
