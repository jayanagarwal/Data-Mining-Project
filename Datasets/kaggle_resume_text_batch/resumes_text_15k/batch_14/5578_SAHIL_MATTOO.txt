ANALYTICS PORTFOLIO

IBM
· RCA defect prediction based upon Defect description using NLP and model was trained using Machine Learning 
RC applications were first clustered into groups, and Defect description was Tokenised using BagOfWords to form a TDM Corpus which was processed using Tidy Text and then using, Sparse Matrix, the TDM was created which was modelled using Random Forest. Gini Index was used to feature engineer the top 50 influencing tokens to predict RC application – On Going
· Analysis on Reducing the Defect Life Cycle to minimize the man hours efforts
Text Analytics performed on the comments provided the insight on the frequent stage where defect has spent maximum number of days. Applied Paired T-Tests (ANOVA) to understand the mean number of days defect spend in each phase to determine the Null Hypothesis. 

Great Lakes Institute of Management
· CAPSTONE - Statistical model build on the technical indicators like Trend, Volatility, Volumetric & Momentum for Indian Stock market using ARIMA Time Series Technique for forecasting the stock price and Random Forest to train the model to predict the next 20 days. Used 10-FOLD Cross Validations to assess overfitting.
· Comparative analysis for various Machine Learning techniques like ANN, KNN, SVM & Ensemble for the Prediction of choice of Transport for company employee. Used AIC and BIC Statistical benchmark to access the model, applied regularization technique, Lasso to access the impact of coefficients. 
· Using ANN to analyze the Churn Model for the Banking Segment using H2O in R
· Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images using Keras in Google Collaboratory (Python)
· Market Basket Analysis on grocery receipts using Apriori and Eclat Association Rules and provide the recommendation for the Food Store. 
· Investigate the factors for Employee Attrition using Neural Network and CART, an Ensemble Model was created that identified the cause of employee attrition.
· Built a model based on Discriminant Analysis to predict whether a customer will purchase a book or not based on past e-mail campaign response data. The Result were assessed based upon the loss function computed specific to the sale price of the books.
· Applied Dimensionality Reduction using PCA and FA on the Top 100 US cereal brands to identify the key brand parameter. Used Scree Plot, Communality, Factor scores and Rotations.

Descriptive Analytics 
· Regions prone for Crimes committed in India
· Relation between Inflation, Crude Oil, Dollar and Fiscal Deficit
ORGANIZATIONAL EXPERIENCE


IBM, Bangalore 										Since Oct'10
