	· Project Location: Bangalore
	· Site:Offshore

	· Skill Used: Hive ,Sqoop ,Oozie ,Hdfs  
	· Team Size: 16

	· Project Description: 
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company is an American multinational enterprise information technology company. 
It uses various databases like- MFGProd, Dzyon, SapProd, Sybase, Netsuit to store its transaction details. We fetch the data into HDFS and do analysis. We have two layers in Hive. AZ is the first layer to which we directly dump the data either using Sqoop or using the WinScp to load the data to Hadoop local and from there using load command to Hive table. As we have some tables to be loaded the data from FlatFiles, We create a Temporary table to store the intermediate date, where we use SerDe to clean the data and store it in the format we want.  Using Insert command we put the Temporary table data in the External table. Once the AZ load is over, we move to the second layer called IC-layer. To which we load the data from AZ by writing HQLs, referring to the STTMs written by the data modeller. For security we encrypted the data and store in HDFS. 

· Role Description   : 

Worked in data ingestion of transactional as well as historical data into Hdfs using Sqoop. Involved in writing UDF to encrypt and decrypt the data. Create Temporary and External tables to store the data. Writes insert command to load the data from temporary to external to handle date which is not in hive supported format and Boolean values which are in the forms of 0s and 1s. Using Regex command replace and ignore the unwanted symbols which is there in data.
