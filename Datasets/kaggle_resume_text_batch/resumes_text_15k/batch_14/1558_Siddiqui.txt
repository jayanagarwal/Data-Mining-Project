Subject: [External] RE: 1701-1239 Dual Control

I have successfully tested the changes in ESA and did a demo with the business and they are happy with the current 
process. We are missing two fields that need to be done for dual control, Name (ADRC-NAME1) and VAT Registration 
No. (KNA1-STCEG). Great work on this, hopefully we can move quickly on this effort. 
 
Get me the BRD and FS so we can begin changes in EDA. 
 
Below is the current list of fields in ESA, add the two additional fields for the complete documentation of dual control 
fields. 

  
Thanks.

Hi Marjorie, 
 
The complete requirement has been completed in the ESA environment, including the new dual control, addition of the 
sensitive fields and the greying out of the delivery block. You may test it. 
 
I am in the process of creating the BRD and FS, will share the estimate once it is completed. 
 
Security team will separately share the estimate for assigning the roles.

This sales order is in ESA300. We are able to change the delivery block from the current value to blank which will allow 
the delivery to be entered. The new code should not allow the user to change to blank if the customer master dual 
control has not been approved.

Hi Marjorie, 
 
Thank You! 
 
We wanted to ask about the delivery block (we will create a new Z for dual control).

You mentioned, the delivery block is getting removed without the approval (FD08). Can you please share the example or 
screenshots where the block was removed without the approval?

I have tested these and shown the business clients. We have a few more issues with this. The delivery block should not 
be able to release until the changes have been confirmed using FD08. I think we need to create a new delivery block Z6 
Dual Control (whatever the next number available is on the Z list) and not allow this delivery block to be remove until 
FD08 is approved. Let me know the effort for this and I appreciate you getting this done quickly as it needs to be moving 
forward.

Hi Marjorie, 
 
As discussed during the call, you wanted that sales order should not be blocked, and delivery block should be set up 
instead. 
We have done these changes in the ESA environment, can you please test it and let us know your comments on the 
same.

Was trying to test this today but am getting an error message when attempting to access the customer that I just 
updated that it is blocked by me. I think there must be something happening with ESA. Will attempt to test again next 
week unless Basis responds back today.

You can check it from your end and let us know if we need to schedule a call with you tomorrow on this.

Hi Marjorie, 
 
We have created the change C1704-0150. We will develop this first in Sandbox for your POC. 
Once completed in Sandbox we will notify you.

Sameed, 
 
Please proceed with the creating a change ticket for this incident and proceed with the effort to work this. I would like 
to do a POC in the Sandbox first so we can see how this will really work before we impact our development client. Do 
you agree with my thinking? 
 
Let’s discuss if possible. 
 
Thanks.

Subject: 1701-1239 Dual Control 
 
Team, 
 
What would be required and effort to include fields from the sales area data to the dual control functionality? The 
business is wanting to include Incoterms. I know that dual control currently only does General Data and Company Code 
Data fields but can it also include Sales Area Data? 
 
Thanks. 
 
Marjorie
