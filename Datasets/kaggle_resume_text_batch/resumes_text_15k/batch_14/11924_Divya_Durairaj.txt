	Key projects worked


#1 Self-service � Endorsement Inquiry screen
Title


: Endorsement Inquiry screen
Operating System
: OS/400

Technology

: ISeries

Role


: ISeries Application Developer

Language

: RPGLE, CLLE

Data Base

: DB2 400

Period


: November 2014- January 2015
Project Objective:

An innovation project which was developed as a self-service that brings all the changes done to an insurance policy in a single space and displays in a screen.

Description:

SIS, popularly known to the business users as Seagull is the legacy policy administration system hosting Auto and Property policies for all partner club states. It currently serves 42 products across 18 states and has 656K total active policies.

On an average, SIS handles 1000 endorsement transactions per day, and 920 of these transactions are being initiated by the Customer Support staff through direct phone call from the customers.

To handle the endorsement request calls from the customers, CSRs would require to investigate and understand the current status of a policy and prior endorsement details.

Currently, there is no easy way or tool available for the CSRs to review and understand the details of an endorsement and they heavily rely on user notes which are often not very detailed.

CSRs spend a lot of time to research past policy transactions and fulfill customers� request for policy changes. 
On an average, approximately 220 CSRs spend at least 40 minutes per day in investigating past policy endorsements.

I came up with an �Endorsement Inquiry� screen to address the pain area. This screen is capable of instantly displaying the exact changes made by the user through a policy endorsement.
· The new screen will completely eliminate the need for CSRs to go through multiple screens and policy notes to understand an endorsement transaction
· It will help the CSRs to quickly fulfill the customer needs.

· Improve customer satisfaction as they don�t have to be on the phone for a long time
Most importantly, it aligns with the CEM vision of �making every interaction a ten� as it will help all the goals stated below:
· Lower customer wait times due to the reduction in call duration.

· More issues will be resolved the first time.

· Greater consistency will be felt across all touch points.
This innovation was presented in a Town Hall to CIO of the organization and was appreciated.
#2 Undo Renewal
Title


: Undo renewal
Operating System
: OS/400

Technology

: ISeries

Role


: ISeries Application Developer

Language

: RPGLE.
Data Base

: DB2 400

Period


: November 2015 - December 2015

Project Objective:

Backing out the pending renewal transaction done to a policy.

Description:

SIS policies get renewed either manually or automatically based on the business scenario. In few cases, FTS team need to revert or undo the renewal in order to correct some policy attribute.
There were no easy way or tool available for the FTS team to undo the renewal. They had to rely on a manual process which includes data base updates with the help of IT team. This was a time consuming process which delays the renewal.

We came up with an option to undo the renewal transaction. It completely eliminates the manual intervention of IT team. Option immediately roll-backs the Renewal transaction from all the transaction files.
· The average time spent by FTS team to undo the transaction has been considerably reduced.
· Incident inflow count for performing Undo transaction has been controlled.
#3 SIS Online Explorer tool
Title


: SIS Online Explorer tool.
Operating System
: OS/400

Technology

: ISeries

Role


: ISeries Application Developer

Language

: RPGLE

Data Base

: DB2 400

Period


: March 2016 - May 2016
Value-Add Objective:

Provided detailed description for the error messages when error occurs online.
Description:

Currently, SIS users are presented with standard messages wherever they encounter an error.

Standard - single line messages don�t provide enough information to the users regarding the error happened, and how to recover from the same. So, users tend to create an incident ticket to resolve the error. Providing detailed error messages along with recovery steps would be beneficial to the users.

Below are the targeted Screens and scenarios which provides detailed error information:

Client Information Screen

· Deleting Named Insured Details

· Modifying Named Insured Details

· Modifying Mailing Address Details

· Addition of Mailing Address

Membership Screen

· Removal Of Membership Discount

Credit-Score Screen

· Modification of Credit-Score

A window will be popped up to explain the detailed message.
· Self-service and no ticket creation for Service Desk Representatives.
· Incident Influx reduction (on an average 3 incidents/month).
· Faster turnaround time.
#4. Web service enhancement
Title


: Web service enhancement
Operating System
: OS/400

Technology

: ISeries

Role

Description:

CSAA Policy Administration System - SIS support many real time services like payment, policy lookup etc. SOA transmit such real time service requests to AS400. Currently, SOA depends on IBM WebSphere BPM Adapter to communicate with AS400 server or consume AS400 functionalities which is in turn used by the front end applications. This adapter is an external hardware which has huge licensing cost.

Solution:
IBM Websphere BPM Adapter is replaced by SOAP based inbuilt web service feature. A new user profile authentication is introduced at iSeries level to improve the security. 

Benefits:

· License cost optimization.
· Overall real-time services performance is increased by 60%.
· All communications between SOA and AS400 are encrypted using SSL certificate.
