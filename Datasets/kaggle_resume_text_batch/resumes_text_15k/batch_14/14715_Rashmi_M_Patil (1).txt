	Description
	Goal Based Modeling (GBM) is a standardized fixed price modelling contract. It is one of the web based interface used to set the contract goals and it gets the result based on goal set. This is one of the model to automatically build the contract terms based on goal set.It is a tool that will model current hospital contracts as standardized fixed price contracts, allowing new contracts to be created based on the new models. It converts hospital’s ‘percentage of charge’ contract terms into standardized ‘fixed priced’ contract terms while enhancing business processes ultimately resulting in cost reduction of hospital claims. Humana calculates the pricing based on percentage of charge pricing. But it results in increase of refund cost for Humana. To minimize this loss Humana decides to set a fixed price for pricing a claims. Fixed price may vary according to the market analysis. By using this model, Humana can pay optimum price to the provider where Humana cannot be in loss.

This modified Map0 is used for the production wafer map of a lot at the first process step of product manufacturing. The Map0 is used for collecting the measurements of optical inspections that involves capturing of the errors occurring on a wafer by scanning the wafer using the scanner and microscope. The UWM system is used for tracking fail lines in the wafer at different sites by automatic upload of the Yield managers defect density measurements. The summary map which is the summary of the electrical maps is generated real-time using the UWM system. The UWM tool also provides an importing and exporting functionality of wafermaps into different wafer formats namely IFX standard Format layout, the WQL layout used for the prober setup, the KLA result file containing the defect density measurement from the Yield manager system.
