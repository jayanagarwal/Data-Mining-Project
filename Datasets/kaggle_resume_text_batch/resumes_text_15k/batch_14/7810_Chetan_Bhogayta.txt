of the important modules of SmartTrials 3.0 product. ODR deals with clinical trials operational data for all studies which 
comes under all clinical trials. It consists of ETL part which extract data from various source systems as RAVE, IMPACT 
etc. from various vendors and transform into industry standard table structures which is managed by job management 
module based on UNIX crontab utility. Also applied data quality checks at source layer for data validation. Product 
features UI for monitoring data and scheduling data flow for daily batches.
