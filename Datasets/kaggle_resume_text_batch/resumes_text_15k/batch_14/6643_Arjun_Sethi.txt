Later on BT decided to launch the service in the market by the name of BT RealTime. The solution has resulted in radical reduction in cycle time which was envisaged to be major hurdle for the customer going for bandwidth boost, CoS parameter changes, application and CoS mapping requests for their iVPN products. The radical solution will also result in increased revenue for BT. Due to zero touch, real time self service, there will be significant reduction in operations cost and improved customer experience.
