Experience
Saama Technologies, Inc Pune
Data Scientist August-2015–Present
+ FAE - Developing Data Science Modules for Big Data using Apache Spark in Fluid Analytics’ Engine.

Responsible for data pre-processing, data cleaning, exploratory analysis and visualization, transformation
and deriving new variables for feature selection and machine learning algorithms.

+ Adjility - International Reference Pricing and Launch Sequence Optimization. Algorithm Development
in R for International Reference Pricing, Launch Sequence Optimization - Predictive Modeling and
Forecasting. Gathering requirements through client interaction, to understand their requests and needs
and thereby providing best solution possible.

+ Cisco - Analyzing Cisco DNA Product to gauge Positive and Negative Influencing Factors. Extracted
reviews for Cisco DNA Products through Web Scraping, built the Local Corpus. Then applied
Sentiment Analysis to it and nally derived Top Inuencing Positive and Negative Factors impacting it.

+ Ebay - Build REST API for Customer Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining. Using R and Python
built app to crawl comments from social media and predicted the sentiments.

+ Valora - Revenue forecasting using Time Series and Market basket analysis.Created dashboards for
revenue forecasting and stock details of shops. Used MBA to increase the sale of products.

+ Otsuka - Cancer Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (Deep Learning). Using
python tools like Keras and Tensorflow to classify the cancer stages by learning medical images.

+ MAPI - MAPI Literature Search. Using R and Python analyzed literature pdf documents to extract the
particular adverse effects, also created some dashboards to categorize those abstracts and to display
the abstract reports.
