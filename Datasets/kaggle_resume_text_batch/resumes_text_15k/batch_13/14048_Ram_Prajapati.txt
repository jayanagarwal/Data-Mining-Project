Due to the rush in meeting the 10/01 deadline of liability shift, many of First data merchants are in a rush to certify them in EMV. The basic function of the team is to do the setup for the new merchants on First Data network, perform analysis of the data received from the vendors, report errors if any, route the transaction to multiple brands once the internal comfort level is achieved and get the merchant certified by the different associations like Master card, Visa, Amex and Discover.

4. HBOS – Banking & Savings Resource Pool – Savings Roll Number      
      (Team Size: 5 - Feb-2010 to Jul-2011)

Business perspective: The project mainly involved increasing the range of account numbers to accommodate more no. of accounts. 
 
Technical perspective: Unique roll numbers are created under different departments. Roll numbers under savings department (Say dept ‘xx’) was about to exhaust. So from then onwards all new savings accounts opened had to be enrolled under a new department (say ‘yy’). So all the programs which were treating dept - xx as valid department had to be altered to treat dept - yy also as a valid department. 

This project mainly involved analyzing the specifications, searching for all the programs getting affected using some key words related to roll numbers and department field, preparing technical design, build, unit testing, system testing prior to implementation. 

I was involved in technical design for altering existing batch modules and technical design for three new modules, build and unit testing of the modules designed by me. 

As a fresher, I utilized this opportunity to learn a lot of things both in technical area and process areas. 

Responsibilities

· Estimating the effort and preparing the low level project plan.
· Analysis of Assembler modules & providing the resolution document for the changes.
· Coding, testing and documenting the work done.
· Review of team members’ work.

· Leading the team from process front.
· Peer review, Attending Client status calls, providing project status update to the customers, managing the issues and concerns in the team. 



Value additions in project:
1. Automated the batch suite in test region using JCL. It made submissions of 50+ jobs one after another based on the success/failure of the previous job and several other conditions. It saved 1.5 hrs per batch run. Frequency of the batch run was around 18 per month and so, the total effort saved was around 27 hrs per month i.e. 3.30 Man days per month.

2. Data Copy tool: The tool copies Customer records, their related Policy/AML/Name and description records from production to test/production support regions using DFSORT & HL ASM. This tool saves 30 mins per data copy. Average frequency of data copy request is 10 per day. The total effort saved is around 150 hrs per month/ 18.75 Man days per month.

3. Test file creation tool: This tool used to create cut versions of all the files used in the system (for testing/support purpose). It made volume testing easier and faster. The customer sensitive data were removed by the tool every time a cut version file was created. Nothing is saved in terms of effort but the tool made testing easier than ever before.
