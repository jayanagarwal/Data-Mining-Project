     Database			:	SQL SERVER 2008.
Project Description:  
			Dynamic data websites work on top of the scaffolding framework from Microsoft. The basic idea behind a dynamic data website is that once we have a database ready with us, we can create a data context for this database using either "SQL" or "Entity Framework". 

Once we have the data context ready with us, we can use this context, and the web pages that will perform database operations will be generated at runtime. The important thing to notice is that a dynamic data website generates pages at runtime and it is not some auto generated code by Visual Studio. It does use some template pages and controls to render the actual data, which in fact is a good thing because it gives us the possibility of customization as per our needs.

Responsibilities:
· Designed and developed user interface using MVC, Entity Framework and C#.
· Developed SQL queries , Stored procedures and Functions to retrieve and update data from database.

Environment: Visual Studio, MVC, C#.NET, ADO.NET, HTML, SQL Server.
