Project description:
To the best of our knowledge, there is no research discussing and analyzing the authentication as well as trust and reputation of CSPs and SNPs for CC-WSN integration. Filling this gap, this paper analyzes the authentication of CSPs and SNPs as well as the trust and reputation about the services of CSPs and SNPs. Further, this paper proposes a Novel authenticated trust and reputation calculation and management (ATRCM) system for CC-WSN integration. Particularly, considering (i) the authenticity of CSP and SNP; (ii) the attribute requirement of CSU and CSP; (iii) the cost, trust and reputation of the service of CSP and SNP, the proposed ATRCM system achieves.
