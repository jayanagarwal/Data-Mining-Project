PROJECTS

Implementation of End Of Train Telemetry (EOTT)

Client: Internal Customer (Advanced Development Project).
Role: Designing and Coding.
Software: Keil.
Hardware: TM4C129EXL-EK/DK, Radio, GPS receivers, Buzzers, LCD and others.
Language: Embedded C.
 Protocols:  SPI, UART, ARP, UDP.
Team: 3 No’s.
Duration: 14 months. 
Description: 
Entirely new and vital railway safety system which was taken up as an ADP project to prove TATA POWER SED‘s capability in Railways. 
The basic requirements for this system are derived referring to South African EOTT systems.
This System has two major units CDU (Communication Display Unit) and SBU (Sense Brake Unit).
The CDU is meant to be Mounted in the locomotive while the SBU to be mounted at the tail end of train replacing Guard Coach.
In the Ideal Case Scenario CDU and SBU Communicate over radio, exchanging their crucial parameters like GPS Co-ordinates and Other information which enables both the units to monitor the train intactness or integrity.
In case of emergency like train detachments while moving, SBU present at the end of train notifies the CDU which enable the driver to acknowledge the situation. If the driver fails to acknowledge the rear unit (SBU), it has the Capability to Apply brake on its own preventing further Discrepancies.   

Responsibilities:
· Development of Software for CDU and SBU.
· Development of software for Simulator.
· Making the Code compliance as per the SIL standard and MISRA C.
· Code Analysis & Event-log analysis and fixing the bugs. 

Implementation of Station TCAS System

Client: RDSO (Research Designs and Standards Organization).
Role: Designing and Coding.
Software: Keil.
Hardware: LPC 2378, MCB-2300.GPS, Data-logger, radios, GSM.
Language: Embedded C
 Protocols:  CAN, I2C, SPI and UART
Team: 6 No's 
Certification: Safety Integrity Level 4(SIL 4) 
Duration: 8 months. 
Description: A powerful railway safety system under development with RDSO. The requirements for this system are derived from the experience with ACD systems. In TCAS a customized TDMA protocol is used to manage communication which offers better reliable communication channel than compared with carrier sense alone. Station TCAS allots slots for Loco TCAS for transmission. TCAS uses RF Tags and relies less on GPS for absolute position and Track identification. Station TCAS taps information from the Railway Signaling systems and updates the loco with the signaling information for the next two signals as well as braking target in case of danger as the Loco TCAS does not have any database regarding the layout.



Responsibilities:
· Designed and implemented the specification outlined by RDSO for prototype along with the team from scratch.
· Application & system programming development of Station TCAS.
· Customized TDMA Protocol for TCAS Network.
· Unit testing of functionalities.

Implementation of Real Time Data Logger In Station TCAS

Client: RDSO (Research Designs and Standards Organization).
Role: Designing and Coding.
OS: Linux Debian
Hardware: ICOP 6150E, GSM SIM900A
Language: C
Protocols: CAN, UART
Team: 2 No's
Duration: 3 months.
Description: A Real Time Data Logger is used to Store Real Time Events Occurring in Station TCAS System For example the Signal Information of LOCO TCAS will receive from Station TCAS. When Real Time Events Happens for example LOCO SPAD The information will send to Concern person mobile through GSM Modem. 
First Version of Real Time Data Logger was developed using Vxworks and next Version in Linux Environment.   
Responsibilities:
· Responsible for design and development of software.
· Interfacing the peripherals, functional testing.
· Unit and Function Level testing.
· Preparation of user manual.
