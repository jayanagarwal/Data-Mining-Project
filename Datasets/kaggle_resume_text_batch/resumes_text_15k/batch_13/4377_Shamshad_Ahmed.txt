ABOUT ME 
 

“I am a dedicated person with a 

family of three. I enjoy watching 

movies & reading. The knowledge 

and perspective that my work as a 

consultant gives me has 

strengthened my thought process 

and problem-solving abilities. I have 

been successful at raising a family, 

and I attribute this success to my 

ability to find solutions to problems, 

plan, schedule, and handle many 

different tasks at once. This flexibility 

helps me at life & work both, where 

there are many different problems 

and approaches to solve them.”
