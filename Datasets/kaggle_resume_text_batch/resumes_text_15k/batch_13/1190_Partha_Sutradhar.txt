Dear Sir /Madam, 

I am an accomplished team player / team leader with a “can-do” attitude looking for a new career challenge in a hands-on role where I can contribute not only my experiences to date, but also my strong reporting and analysis skills to create win-win solutions.

I have learnt how an organization works and different aspects of working in a BPO. I have observed different roles and learnt to work under different circumstances. I learnt how to work in a team. I have learnt how a corporate body works through properly managed teams and groups and how even an individual action can play an important role for overall production. I always tried to put all my efforts to see my team on top. My peers and team leaders helped me a lot as and when required. I learnt how to help my peers in achieving their targets and how to take initiatives.

I possess the capability of managing a group, understanding their needs, finding out their weaknesses and strengths which in return enable in finding out their targets. I have worked as a team player and know the various aspects in which a team performs.

I have always prided myself on being a high-achiever and am using this opportunity to move into a new role that will offer new challenges to push my team and myself to achieve success. 

I thank you for considering my application and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely

Partha Sutradhar
