EDUCATIONAL RECORD
· Indian Institute of Technology Madras Chennai, India

M.Tech in Industrial Mathematics and Scientific Computing  July2006 - June2008

Title of the thesis: Estimation of time delays in nonlinear systems using Average Mutual Amount of Information

· Sri Krishna Devaraya University Anantapur, India

Master of Science in Statistics August 2002 - June. 2004

Specialized in Operations Research, Statistical Quality Control and Computer Programming.
· Sri Sai Baba National Degree College Anantapur, India

Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Sciences August 1999 - May. 2002
· M.Tech Thesis:
· Developed a non-parametric method to estimate time delay from routine operating data for multivariate systems using average mutual information theory.

· Statistical analysis was performed on the values of average mutual information and the Beta distribution has been proved to be a better choice in estimating the confidence intervals for the estimate.
· M.Tech Mini Projects
· Implemented C code for solving linear system of equations using various numerical schemes as part of Numerical Linear Algebra course.
· Simulated one-dimensional and two-dimensional PDEs using Finite Point Set Method (FPM) in C++ and MATLAB.
· Implemented Monte Carlo simulation of various continuous probability distributions as part of Stochastic Methods for Industry using MINITAB software. 

· Implemented hypothesis testing, non-parametric methods, design and analysis of experiments, curve fitting, linear models and regression analysis as part of Applied Statistics course using MINITAB software.

· Project 1: Cross Selling Mortgage Loans (August 2008 - October 2008)
· Summary: The main objective is to build a statistical model to predict the probability of successfully cross-selling home loan (mortgage) to credit card customers.
· Roles and Responsibilities: Cleansing the raw data, dumping cleansed data into database (Oracle), profiling the dumped data to find out measures of central tendency. Chi-square test (categorical variables), T-test (continuous variables) is used to test the significance of variables for the response variable. Finally building and validating the statistical model built using Logistical Regression model.
Technologies: Oracle, SAS, MS-Excel.
· Project 2: Probability of Sale Model (October 2008 - to date)
· Summary: The main objective is to build a Probability of Sale Model to predict the 

probability of a sale happening in the Queue.
· Roles and Responsibilities: Cleansing the raw data, dumping cleansed data into database 

(Oracle), profiling the dumped data to find out measures of central tendency. Chi-square test (categorical variables), T-test (continuous variables) is used to test the significance of variables for the response variable.
