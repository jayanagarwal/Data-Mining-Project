About Myself


I think determination, dedication, and hard work can help to achieve one's desired goals in life. I also can organize a program confidently with others even under pressure. I can be a team leader if responsibility is entrusted to me. My outlook towards the various struggles and hardships in life is: Dedication and hard work does pay. Just work hard towards your goal and don't bother about the failures that may arise for it has been rightly said that failure is the pillar of success. The valuable keywords that inspire me to go ahead with my allotted task are the three D’s, which are “Determination, Dedication and Diligence”
