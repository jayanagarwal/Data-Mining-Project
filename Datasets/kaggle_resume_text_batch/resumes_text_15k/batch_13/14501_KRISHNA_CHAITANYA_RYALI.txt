PROJECTS:
Project : HIMSHAKTHI (BEL, HYDERABAD)

	HIMSHAKTHI is a networking project which provides communication between two stations called base radio and remote radio sponsored by BEL (bharath electronics limited). File transfer and voice communication will be provided between these two stations. Each station will have different configuration based on requirement, This configuration can be applied to radio using SNMP Protocol. My role is to develop SNMP agent software using C and writing MIB (Management Information Base) file. C Application includes reading and writing data to/from serial devices and flash memory. SNMP MANAGER establishes connection with Radio using the SNMP protocol. The information needs to be exchanged between SNMP agent and Manager is defined in MIB and exchanged via SNMP protocol, Manager is responsible for configuring and managing radio.

	Programming Languages	:	C,  MIB development.
	Protocols			:	SNMP.
Project :TDOA BASED LOCATION FIXING SYSTEM (DERL Hyderabad). 
	
	This project is to find the location of the Emitter.The Project ELF System (Emitter Location Finding System) is sponsored by DERL (Defence Electronics Research Laboratory). The Entire System consists of five sensor units will be located at different places which can be used to find Emitter, GUI establishes communication with all sensor units and receives data related to Emitter location. It uses maps to display sensor, emitter position. In this project I developed C based application which establishes connection with GUI units using TCP protocol. GUI application sends configuration to sensor software and receives response and displays result.
	Programming Languages	:	C, Socket Programming.
	Protocols			:	TCP.

Project : INTERNAL-TDOA BASED LOCATION FIXING SYSTEM(ICOMM-HYD)
	
	This project is to find the location of the Emitter. The Project ELF System (Emitter Location Finding System) is sponsored by DERL (Defence Electronics Research Laboratory). The Entire System consists of five sensor units will be located at different places which can be used to find Emitter, GUI establishes communication with all sensor units and receives data related to Emitter location. It uses maps to display sensor, emitter position. In this project i have developed C application which acts like tcp/ip client and receives sensor unit configuration as predefined packets. Necessary action to be taken based on the configuration received.
	Programming Languages	:	C, Socket Programming.
	Protocols			:	TCP.
