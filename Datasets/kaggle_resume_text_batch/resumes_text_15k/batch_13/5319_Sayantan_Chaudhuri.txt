Achievements & Recognition 

 Promoted twice in a span of 3.5 years 
 Received Rising Star Award 2015 Q1 and Master mind award 2015 Q3 at EXL-DA Level, for bringing in robustness and 

scientism across analysis making the insights valuable and unimpeachable  
Roles & Responsibilities 
 
 Responsible for creating actionable insights from customer behavior, trends and characteristics extracted through analytics, 

data mining, and statistical hypothesis testing using SQL and SAS 
 Individual contributor for major strategic analysis & insight generation projects – independently handling their end to end 

delivery 
 Development of major regulatory dashboards and MI scorecards – and ensure their timely delivery  
Organizational development 
 
 Mentored campus hires within the team – in terms of technical and business knowledge transfer and QC-ing all their major 

analysis.  
 Frequently conducted knowledge sharing session involving both offshore and onshore analytics team to discuss advanced 

statistical techniques- K means algorithm, PCA – which were greatly appreciated by client. 
 

MAIN PROJECTS 
 
Designing Services profiling tool for any arbitrary cohort of customers 

 Designed a fully automated SAS MACRO based tool which is capable of creating comparative profiles of any two arbitrary 
cohort of customers  

 Implemented proportionality Z-test in the tool, to capture simultaneously, any statistically significant difference in the profile 
distribution of the two given cohorts 

 Through profile distribution and Z-test , the tool helped the client to infer how are two customer cohorts different/similar to 
each other 

 The tool virtually became ubiquitous in almost every project involving profiling of customers and was highly appreciated by 
client  
Tools used SAS MACRO , Excel 
Technique used Profiling, comparing equality of proportions using Z Test 
 

Logistic regression model for predicting on demand jobs 

 Developed logistic regression model to predict whether a particular customer would request for an on demand job or not 
 Validated the model on test dataset and obtained significant cumulative lift ~68% in top 50 percentile population 
 The model got implemented on ground by stakeholder and it helped them to optimize their logistic resources by focusing 

primarily on regions with higher concentration of high propensity customer  
Tools used Teradata, SAS EG, Excel 
Technique used Logistic regression 

 
Analyzing the effect of smart meters on customers’ fuel usage pattern 

 Prepared test and control group (ensured  independence b/w the two) of customers by considering “Smart Meter installed” as a 
treatment. 

 Studied the mean fuel consumption of test and control group using Two Sample TTest, to infer about the effect of Smart Meters 
on reduction of it.

 For some of the cohorts fuel consumption in test/control group was not following Normal distribution. Used non parametric 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Wilcoxon Mann-Whiney U-Test) for these cases using PROC NPAR1WAY 

 Identified those cohorts where mean consumption had not significantly decreased  even with Smart Meter installation. Profiled 
these cohorts to understand their behavior and thereby develop strategic insight for them. 
Tools used Apache HIVE, SAS EG, Excel 
Technique used Two Sample TTest, WMW Test, KS & Cramer-Von-Mises 

test of normality, Profiling  
 
Survival analysis of HIVE customers 

 Extensive use of Teradata to create an end to end view of customer relationship from acquisition to churn  
 Preparation of test & control group to study the effect of smart devices( HIVE active heating) on customer survival rate 
 Used chi-square test of homogeneity to ensure that there is no statistically significant difference b/w the “test & control” 

group in terms of customer attributes. Upon rejection of the above hypothesis, used stratification using PROC 
SURVEYSELECT to ensure that the test and control group are  indeed homogeneous  
Tools used Teradata, SAS EG, Excel 
Technique used Designing test & control group, Chi square test, Survival 

curve
