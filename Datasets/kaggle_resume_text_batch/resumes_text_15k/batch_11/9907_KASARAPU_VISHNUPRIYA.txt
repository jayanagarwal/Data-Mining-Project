PROJECT NAME: DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF FREE JET WIND TUNNEL  

DESCRIPTION: A low-speed free-jet wind tunnel has been designed and analysed. A series of 

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and experimental evaluations were conducted to determine the 

flow quality and to verify the wind tunnel suitability for aerodynamic studies. Initially, at 25% and at 

75% of total length a mesh screens are to be placed to find the mean velocity and turbulent intensity. 

These results show that flow quality was significantly affected by boundary layer controllers(mesh 

screens) in the settling chamber and wide angle diffuser.
