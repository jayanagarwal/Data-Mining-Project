Work Experience 
Decision Scientist, Mu Sigma Business Solution Pvt Ltd                   October 2015 – Present  
Projects Delivered 

• For a major US Airline –  
Turn Time Reduction using Video Analytics: 

▪ Worked with their Corporate Strategy team to identify potential reasons of flight delay using deep learning algorithms on video stream 

data & generate actionable insights to improve on-time performance of flights  

▪ Implemented a Computer Vision solution using Google’s ReInspect & YOLO to track & count humans & baggage on Jet-Bridges with an 

accuracy of above 95% 

▪ Experimented with multiple image processing techniques like HOG-SVM, HAAR-Cascade with Image Subtraction to improve accuracy of 

object detection & understand the complexity of the solution 

▪ Deployed an end-to-end automated real-time solution leveraging an in-house built IoT platform, IP Cameras & GPU based Cloud 

infrastructure at the Airport using Flight APIs, motion detection, object tracking & counting & integrating the data into cli ent’s 

environment 

Baggage Check-In Throughput Analysis using Image Subtraction: 
▪ Helped their Continuous Improvement team to improve the baggage check-in process by analysing the throughput patterns at the belts 

& enabling them to make operational changes at the Airport using Video Analytics 

▪ Deployed wireless cameras at the baggage belts and implemented image subtraction technique to count baggage at the check-in belts 
with over 94% accuracy 

▪ Studied the impact of operational changes by running a pre-post analysis on baggage throughput patterns between the belts & self-check 
kiosks through batch processing 
Banner Optimization by building an Image Processing Engine: 

▪ Helped their Marketing team to understand the drivers of customer response by performing a driver analysis on the banner data & 

booking data & provided recommendations for designing email banner creatives 

▪ Built an Image Processing Engine to extract the Design & Content features present in the banner by implementing Optical Character 

Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract & Object/Icon detection using TensorFlow based neural networks SSD & YOLO 

▪ Experimented with various pre-processing techniques like Binarization, Noise removal. Erosion/Dilation to improve feature extraction 

accuracy & explored several template matching algorithms to identify banner elements  

▪ Designed the architecture of the web application created for the Image Processing Engine 

 

• For a leading US Bank –  
Text Analytics on Customer Feedback: 

▪ Helped their Platform & Capabilities team improve Customer Experience to identify the source of complaints & understand customer 

sentiments using NLP & Text Analytics  

▪ Performed NLP based text pre-processing by stop-word removal, Tokenization, Stemming/Lemmatization, Parts-of-speech (POS) Tagging, 

custom dictionary corrections & then performed Topic Modelling using TF-IDF with LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation) 

▪ By understanding their business taxonomy, customized grammar was created to identify the complaints and root causes from the 

feedback & Sentiment Analysis was then performed to understand the customer experience  

 

• For a multinational Travel Management Company –  
Report Automation & Standardization: 

▪ Worked with their Data Insights team to improve operational efficiency by automating key performance reports & standardize the QC 

process to reduce 320 to 20 man-hours per month in 8 weeks gaining experience in VBA & Excel like technologies
