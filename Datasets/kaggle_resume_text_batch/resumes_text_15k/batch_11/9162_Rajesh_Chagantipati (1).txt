Title: Ranking And Suggesting Popular Items

Technology: Java,J2EE(JSP, Servlets)

Description: We proposed simple randomized algorithms for ranking and suggesting popular items designed to account for popularity bias. We focused on understanding the limit ranking of the items provided by the algorithms, and how it relates to that of the true popularity ranking and assessed the quality of suggestions as measured by the true popularity of suggested items. We believe that the problem posed in this paper opens interesting directions for future research including analysis of convergence rates of the ranking algorithms, consideration of alternative ranking and suggesting rules, and alternative user choice models.
