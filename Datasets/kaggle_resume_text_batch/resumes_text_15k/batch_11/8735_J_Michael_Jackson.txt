PROJECT PROFILE

Project Title 	:  Secured Atm Transactions to Avoid Counter-Feiting tracing                                                   attacks 
Front end      	:  C (#) Sharp
Back end       	:  Sql Server 

This project is about Atm (Automated Teller Machine) which we are using in our day to day life. But do we think about how secured is Atm Pin. I had an idea of introducing a biometric identification such as the Thumb Print or the Eye Iris instead of the usual Pin number. This is the main aspect of the project. The logic is to get the original finger print of the customer and then split it into 4 equal parts. So whenever the customer uses the pin and the thumb print, the Atm controller checks the pin and the thumb print with the original data’s so  if it matches then money can be withdrawn else money cannot be withdrawn.
