 Work on Decision Tree 
 

Data-Bank Marketing Dataset 

About- The dataset has been downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.The data is related with 

direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. 
I have done with the dataset.The goal is to build models which predict if the client will subscribe a term 

deposit(Y) 

Analysis- Perform some analysis on the dataset by choosing one or two variables and visualizing them,this 

way we can get an idea of how values are distributed for the entire set. 
Take ggplot functions to visualize the data distributions across the variables. 

Modeling- A decision Tree is a robust and transparent Machine Learning Model.It can be used to predict 

whether a particular variable would have mattered in the customer’s decision to subscribe or not to the 
Bank’s term deposit. 

Finally the summary of the Decision Tree plotted with the Chi-Squared value and the P-value. 

 Work on Logistic Regression 
 

Data-  The Quality Dataset 

About- In this dataset we have 131 observations,One for each of the patients in our dataset,and 14 

different variables.The 12 variables from InpatientDays to AcuteDrugGapSmall are the independent 

variables.I am using the number of office visits and the number of prescriptions for narcotics that the 
patient had. 

Analysis- Use Table function to find out the outcome of the variable PoorCare.Next,We will randomly 

split our data into two dataset, Train  and Test dataset.Now,Finding the correlation between all numeric 
variables. 

Modeling- Correlation between PoorCare and AcuteDrugGapSmall is significant,But Correlation between 

AcuteDrugGapSmall and Narcotics is higher and it can Cause the Multicollinearity so we will prefer to 

drop this variable from the Predictions because Narcotics seems more significant variable.So,We will build 
Logistic Regression Model using PoorCare as dependent Variable and OfficeVisits and Narcotics as 

independent variables.Made a Logistic Regression Model that can accurately identity Diabetic Patients 

Who receiving low quality care.The model provide probabilities of somebody Receiving Poor Quality 

Care. 

 Work on Linear Regression   
Data- AirQuality Dataset 

About- I have downloaded the data from stat.ethz.ch site.There are 153 observations and 6 variables.We 

have to create Linear Regression Model.But before that we have to identify the missing values. 



Analysis- In our dataset only Ozone and Solar.R attributes have some missing value.We need to impute 
those missing values(NA).After removing missing values now we perform Linear Regression on our 

dataset. 

Modeling- Apply Linear Regression Algorithm using Least Square Method on Ozone and Wind.Now 

Build scatterplot. The slope of the scatterplot of the line goes downwards,hence there exist a negative 
correlation between Ozone and Wind.  

 

 Internship- 
 

 ‘Research Intern’ for the NITI  Aayog study on “Status on Women in Science          
among  Select Institutions in India: Policy Implications’’ conducted by the Society for 

Socio-Economic Studies and Services (SSESS) during the period 1.08.2017-31.08.2017.  

 

 Experience-  
 

 Working with a NGO (THE GREEN CORNER), as a teacher (for underprivileged children) 
for last 1.5 years. I have also been appointed as the Treasurer in the NGO.
