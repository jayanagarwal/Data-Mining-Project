Campaign Management			                          Algorithms: K-Means and Agglomerative

Helped world’s largest retailer in identifying the drivers of sales during the promotional campaigns (Festive Seasons) and measured the Impact of seasonal campaigns and programs. Response Measurement was used to determine the Significance of the Campaigns and proactively was able to save 2 Million Dollars on Different Campaign Losses.

· Created the base dataset from multiple data sources (transactional and customer data sources). 
· Performed EDA, Outlier treatment, Null value treatments and created final analytical datasets.
· Performed hypothesis testing, double differencing and test and control methodologies to measure the significance of the campaigns.
· Measured the performance of the campaign across weeks and months and analyzed the trends. 

Sales driver analysis		         		   	           Algorithms: Linear Regression and K-Fold

Supported the operations team of largest retailer to identify the effectiveness of different store formats in pilot markets. 

· Data pull from different tables from the data source as per the requirement.
· Performed EDA, Outlier treatment, Null value treatments and created final datasets for analysis. 
· Responsible for building the end to end linear model for sales driver analysis. 
· Executed the linear regression algorithm using stat models, sklearn packages and interpreted the coefficients.
· Based on the P Value, Created new Principal component to increase the models accuracy.
· Identified the top 5 drivers and bottom 5 drivers for sales during the promotional campaigns.
· Computed R2, Adj R2, RMSE, MAE, MSE and shared the results with relevant stakeholders.
· Checked for Autocorrelation, multicollinearity, heteroskedasticity and variance inflation factor hence increased the accuracy by taking the feedback from these metrics.
· Used K folded technique to compare the accuracies across the models and pushed the results of the best models.

Loyalty Cards Subscriptions	   Algorithms: Decision Tree and Random forest and Linear Regression
Helped fortune 500 retailers in building a brand by increasing the adoption of loyalty cards subscriptions.

Responsibilities: 
· Responsible for building the Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms.
· Identified the drivers of loyalty card sales and loyalty card subscriptions. Also, quantified the impact of the drivers.
·  Identified the churn rate of Loyalty customers and estimated the probability of the customers prescribing to the loyalty cards.
· Used Random Forest to build the models and validated the models using KNN Classifier.
· Produced confusion matrix, accuracy score and F1 score for the entire model and compared the accuracy across.

Reducing customer attrition      	              Algorithms:  Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Random forest

Executed multiple customers, market segmentation projects for largest retailer to help in defining the strategies.
· Responsible for designing the business problem and identifying the factors that influence the problem using problem solving frameworks.
· Responsible for designing test and train data sets from multiple resources and constructed the models using base line models (i.e. logistic) and validation models (i.e. KNN Classifier, Random forest) techniques.
· Responsible for developing the model that will provide the probability and odds.
· Analysed the classification report, accuracy score and ROC curve to gauge the performance of the models.
· Identified the Sensitivity, Specificity, Prevalence and Precision for the models and communicated the KPIs to the stakeholders.
· Increase the model accuracy by performing multicollinearity, variance inflation factor analysis. 
· Used K folded technique to compare the accuracies across the models and pushed the results of the best models.

NLP(Natural Language Processing) 				                           Algorithms: Naive Bayes

Sentiment Analysis of social media campaign: Helped fortune 500 retail company in identifying the sentiment of social media campaigns during promotional and seasons cycles 
1. Extracted the data from twitter API , Facebook  API and created base dataset  for sentiment analysis of social media posts
