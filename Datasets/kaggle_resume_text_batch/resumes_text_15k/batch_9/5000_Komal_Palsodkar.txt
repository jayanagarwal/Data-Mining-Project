A time sheet is a method for recording the amount of a worker's time spent on each job. 

Originally developed for an employer to determine payroll, timesheets are not just for payroll anymore. 

 

Timesheets may record the start and end time of tasks, or just the duration. It may contain a detailed 

breakdown of tasks accomplished throughout the project or program. This information may be used for 

payroll, client billing, and increasingly for project costing, estimation, tracking and management. 

 

Some companies provide web-based timesheet software or services that provide a means to track time 

for payroll, billing and project management. 

 

This project management data can make complex cost relationships visible, thereby allowing lower 

costs. This knowledge can drive corporate strategy as users stop performing or reassign unprofitable 

work
