and a 22-fold leap in the procedure codes used in every part of the clinical and business value 
chain. While this will eventually help improve care and drive efficiencies, the complexity and 
breadth of this shift requires organizations to begin remediation and testing now, in close 
cooperation with business stakeholders, to ensure compliance by the proposed Oct. 1, 2015 
deadline.
