  WORK EXPERIENCE 

    Presently working as PROJECT ASSOCIATE in the project (Ad-hoc basis) entitled “Accelerated Life Testing”, in Mathematics and Statistics department, IIT Kanpur since 1st June 2011 under Dr. Debasis Kundu and  Dr. Sharmishtha Mitra.    
    SUMMER INTERNSHIP

· Six weeks summer internship in Sigma Research and Consulting Pvt. Ltd Delhi.   -May & June08 
               As a part of my internship training, I participated in various research activities including preparation of survey instruments, field work, analysis and support in report writing. Within my internship periods I, also participated in field survey that was running by NGO to check the reflection of Campaign in elections.       
     ACADEMIC PROJECTS
· TIME SERIES PROJECT:

Topic: Study and analysis of death rates of Firearm suicides, homicides and Non-Firearm suicides, homicides in Australia from 1915-2004.                                             – November 2010, IITK
    The objective of this project was to fit the separate linear predictive models for each time-series. Firstly detection and removal of trend, diagnosis for stationarity have been done then modeled the time-series using linear integrated stochastic model. Techniques of information theory and likelihood maximization were used for model-identification and parameter-estimation and validation of the assumption of driving white-noise sequence was also done. Finally the fitted models were used for forecasting the future death-rates for the time period 2005-2010.  
· REGRESSION PROJECT:

Topic: Study and analysis of regression of jet turbine engine thrust.                    – April 2010, IITK
     The objective of this project was to study and analyze the regression of the jet turbine engine thrust using various physical factors as regressors. By using SAS software, firstly diagnostics and remedy for possible multicollinearity, parsimonious modeling have been done then residual analysis with diagnostic and removal of possible influence observation and test for homoscadesticity and normality of the error was done.
· SAMPLING PROJECT:
Topic: An opinion survey on Live-in-relation Vs marriage system.                         – April 2008, BHU 
          The objective of the project was to study the view of BHU students regarding the two newly appearing parallel systems, Live-in-relation and our traditional marriage system. The overall conclusion was that the modern youth is deviating from our traditional marriage system and in future this may be replaced by some new tradition for which recently available option is Live-in.
