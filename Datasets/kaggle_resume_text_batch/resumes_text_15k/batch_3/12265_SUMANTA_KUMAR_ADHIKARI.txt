CAREER NARRATION:
IBM India (From 12th October 2015 onwards)
DESIGNATION:
Group Manager, Advanced Analytics, Cognitive Business Decision Support
JOB PROFILE:

Being a part of the Analytical Leadership team, I am instrumental in driving new business initiatives as well as driving the existing projects to on time delivery. Currently leading the Advanced Analytics practice based out of Kolkata location. Managing a 9-member team directly and overseeing another 3 resources.
JOB DESCRIPTION:

Leadership Role - Account Mining:

To increase the penetration of Advanced Analytics in the existing accounts, an initiative was taken to keep traction with the Managers of the existing IBM accounts and through them pitch analytical value-adds to the clients. This involves a thorough understanding of the business needs of the account, potential business challenges that they are facing, sizing & effort estimation & solution roadmap creation etc. Some of the key such initiatives that later converted into new projects are as follows:
· Nestle Price Elasticity Solution: In order to populate the optimization model with the expected behavior of consumers to a price change properly, the relationship between quantity and price must be estimated and put into a mathematical formula to be used within the optimization engine. According to the basic principle of nature on supply and demand, when prices increase, consumers will demand less of a good or service. When prices decrease, the reverse happens. The goal of the demand modeling is to estimate the degree of response for quantity to a change in price.
The team has worked on to calculate the Own Price Elasticity of one set of products for different Market & SKU’s. They went on to derive the Cross-Price Elasticity of the same set of SKU’s against its competition.  Further, the team has also developed the Split Price Elasticity models. All these models were developed in R environment and were compared against the existing SAS environment models. This project received huge client appreciation with client agreed for next phase of this work. Additionally, the client has asked for support to solve some existing business challenges.
· AmerisourceBergen Robotic Process Automation: The business challenge is to create a standalone service to automate benefit verification process for coverage of specific treatment \ services, as well as how much insurance will pay for these services, if anything at all. Current State Process can be split into three parts.

· Intake part has no scope of improvement.

· Eligibility of verification, 2nd part of the process is also outside the scope of refinement. 

· Our scope is to automate the process of benefit verification checking which is currently done by Verification Counselor.

After the verification depending on the accuracy of the data either it is sent to the provider or it is returned to the CRM System to recover.   
As a part of the automation process developed machine learning algorithms using R to predict the requisite parameters with certain degree of confidence. The idea is, if for certain record all parameters are predicted with certain degree of accuracy, the record will not be scrutinized manually, but the recommendation will be provided immediately.
The final automation rate in the implemented environment was calculated around 35-38% on a day to day basis.
· Anthem Robotic Process Automation: Insurance Companies gets a lot of customer information from multiple channels. The challenge that Anthem is facing is to identify a customer uniquely. The bigger challenge is, in case of scenarios where the identified unique customer is not actually unique. Then chances are high that confidential health related information of one individual is send to another person. If such a situation happens then the organization must pay huge penalty.

So, the expectation is twofold:

· Ensure that the customers who are contacting through different touchpoints are identified as unique customer.

· Two different customers cannot be kept under same umbrella at all.
The result was deployed at 96% accuracy level (zero tolerance in the critical parameter) with an automation rate of 45%. 
· Ikea Customer Analytics & Pricing Analytics: Ikea is one of the largest global retailer into home furnishing business. IBM has its long presence into Data warehousing and BI area. Next logical step would be to step into Advanced Analytics area.

Along with existing Lead Architect, the team identified two areas where Advanced Analytics PoC can be done - Pricing & Customer Analytics. Conceptualized solution framework and data model for the identified use cases. Helped Ikea team members to come upto speed in terms of Advanced Analytics model building (in R); and presenting findings using a single integrated Visualization platform (using .NET framework). 

The team has recently presented the overall concept and implementation in front of the client (during their Offshore visit) team. There is a new set of work in the pipeline. 

There are couple of more threads are also in discussion mode.
· Idea Cellular Watson Agent Assist Pilot: Call centers receive numerous calls regarding various issues and sometimes they are repeat calls. Also, it is difficult for agents to attend to different issues fast and give prompt as well as accurate response. Indian telecom giant, Idea Cellular, a prime client of IBM also faced this issue at many call centers. The Goal was to create an automated Chatbot for Idea call center agent, to help in handling their huge amount of customer calls efficiently. 

Watson Agent Assist is a chat-based interface – a guide on all possible steps required for call handling. Watson Agent Assist Pilot a cognitive assistant that understands natural language and provides solutions to call center agents through conversation, was undertaken for selected business processes to assist agents in call handling and getting it “First Time Right”. The key objectives (Results in brackets) of the POC were –

Watson Accuracy – Measure and improve Watson Accuracy based on feedback from experienced agents (Grew from 68% on Day 1 to 89% on Day 7, while the initial target was to achieve 80% accuracy)
Repeat TAS Reduction - Reduce calls from same customer for same issue (6.9% reduced)

Feedback – Capture customer feedback (96% Users felt that Watson would help reduce Repeat Calls) and Help in training new agents fast. Overall avg. Rating – 8.4/10.

This POC received huge appreciation from client and top leaders of IBM, Client is evaluating the business and cost benefits to take this forward and asked IBM to work on the next phase.
Leadership Role – New Account Creation:


Apart from exploring existing opportunities, the team was also involved in creating new opportunity creation. This includes both creation of new accounts as well as creation of new solutions.

· Godrej Vector Borne Disease Predictor: Leading the engagement to predict the intensity of the spread of vector borne diseases using weather data. Later, the project was extended to predict sales using these indices. ML algorithms were used for these.

· Bata Store Productivity Improvement:  Bata Singapore is struggling to maintain it’s market share & they wanted to leverage Analytics to improve their Store productivity. As a part of the work, analyzed data of 10 stores (of overall 41 stores that Bata has in Singapore) and provided insights. We segmented the stores based on their transactional, customer profile & sales pattern, identified stores where actions can be taken and also recommended possible actions. The recommendations include bundling of non-moving products with regular products, store specific incentive for digital transactions etc.
· Bank of Cyprus Customer Analytics: Converted a small request of providing an answer to a query of an RFP to a full-fledged project. Supported the Presales phase, had a few rounds of client calls to explain & convince them about our competency. Also, provided complete support to the IBM Greece team (Sales & Pre-sales) in answering technical and logistic (finding references) queries.  The idea is, once this get converted, this will be primarily delivered from here by me & my team.
· IBM Maintenance Optimization Aviation Cognitive Platform: IMO is IBM's big bet Product in the Predictive Airlines Maintenance area. Team contributed in developing the Advanced Analytics modeling framework on selected Use case. This resulted in huge appreciation successfully and promise for next two quarters to take this initiative forward.
Leadership Role – Team Development:


· Currently leading the Advanced Analytics practice in Kolkata. Currently having a team of 9 members. 3 more resources are my dotted line reportee.

· To spread the awareness about Advanced Analytics, taken sessions on Advanced Analytics across multiple project & service lines.

Individual Contributor Role - Project Delivery:
· Worked in a POC to develop a failure detection model of Tunnel Boring Machine for a large Infrastructure company located in Malaysia.
· Initiated the implementation of CRM Analytics for Turkish Airlines. As a lead of 3 data scientists I am currently involved in customer enablement (onsite) business & data understanding (onsite\ offsite). As a part of agreement, the team is supposed to deliver customer value segmentation (for the entire customer base), customer behavioral segmentation (for the entire customer base), Segment wise churn models, upsell models for identified products. This project was purged due to political uncertainty at Turkey.
· As a part of solution development team created an analytical driven solution known as Pro-active Learning Experience (PLE) for the Learning & Knowledge Team. This solution is envisaged as a customized solution catering to the employee learning needs across organizations.
· Lead a team of 3 freshers to streamline the global supply chain management system of the Royal Dutch Shell Group. The team successfully reduced the overall execution time to less than 3-hours against the initial execution time of nearly 27/30 hours. The overall project duration was 4-weeks only and the technology used by the team was R.

Idea Cellular Ltd. (From 6th June 2011 till 1st August 2014)
DESIGNATION:
Deputy General Manager (Advanced Analytics)

JOB PROFILE:

Build the Advanced Analytics Framework and to ensure the spread and acceptance of analytics across the organization. Cater to the analytical needs of different verticals of the organization (corporate as well as circles), both as an individual contributor and also as a team leader. Enable the business end users about the analytical findings and potential benefits coming out of it. At the same time raise timely alert to the business users (including senior management) about potential threats envisaged and corresponding business impacts. Provide necessary inputs related to impact on analytical processes (and value-adds that analytics can provide) for upcoming transformation initiatives or product\ consulting initiative.
JOB DESCRIPTION:

Leadership Role:
· Driving the Business Benefits by Effective Churn Management Program:
Currently top 70% of the pre-paid stable customer base (about 90% revenue generators of) in all of the 22 Circles is covered under Churn management programs. 150+ different Analytical Models were developed, deployed & regularly monitored by our team. The deployed models are integrated seamlessly with the Campaign Management system so that the updated scores get reflected into CM system. Campaigns are regularly executed by the Operations team with the help of these output. Around 60% of the base on which Marketing initiatives takes place is identified by analytical scores (for all the Voice, VAS & Data businesses). As of the latest calculations campaigns run on the basis of base identified by these models are expected to give around INR 1 billion of incremental revenue.

· Institutionalized the Analytical Modeling Process across Organization: 
Streamlined the requisite processes for model development. Ensured the TAT of each process is optimized without compromising on the quality parameters. By rolling out Server based Code access mechanism, the consistency & sanity of the ABT (& hence the model) is maintained. Currently post business problem identification, the TAT of the complete modeling cycle up to operationalization of scores is around 15 person days.  Also put the Model Tracking mechanism for Analytical Model Performances in place. Identified the KPI’s to be tracked, tracking cycle & inferences to be drawn out of the tracking mechanism. In case the tracking shows a deterioration of performance of any model, a challenger model is developed by the team (similar or alternate statistical techniques) for models with better performance. Won the deal against competitors like Accenture & SAS. The project will start from January.

· Navigating from Product-Centric Approach to Customer Centric Approach:
To get maximum benefits out of the campaigns, a new more customer centric approach was initiated. To identify the affinity of the customer towards a specific product & specific price point a two stage analytical approach is currently explored. The first stage is to segment the customers using their usage & revenue parameters & the second stage is to identify the most likely product based on their product consumption history in recent past (through association \ sequencing methods).

· Driving the Transformation Initiatives:
As a leader of Analytical team, one of the major achievements is to drive the transformation initiative (taken by Idea & the IT partner IBM in December 2010) and ensure that it gets business acceptance. As a functional Project Manager, my job is to co-ordinate and track with multiple IT & Analytics vendors and ensure that due diligence is maintained at their end in terms of quality & timeliness of their output.
