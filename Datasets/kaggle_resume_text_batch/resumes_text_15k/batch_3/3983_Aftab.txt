	KPN Telecom ( Billing Application)
KPN Telecom, Netherlands is based Telecommunication giant which provides

Change related to the invoice process. This is an intermediate Billing Application which prepares the invoice proposals for billing. The system is also responsible for incorporating the price plans details with customer invoices.

CDS(Central Accounts Receivable System):

CDS system within the KPN organization is in support of a ( central ) department for billing and control of revenue . This support is intended for one or more operational services for those with a debtors' ledger and /or

Information is not profitable. CDS is designed to be flexible which makes it relatively quickly, initiating a new administration ( accounts receivable from an executive service ) is not a problem . This makes it possible to , relative, short -term activation . Process a billing and collection process .

KPN has decided to extend the service life of the PSTN and ISDN delivery/service chain till 2018 because these products still are profitable. 

This change is related to the invoice process. The business will be able to indicate whether a debtor with payment manner collect giro after all does not have to pay for the collect giro. This is only possible via the batch delivery & in Name/Address/City interface therefore nothing will change.
