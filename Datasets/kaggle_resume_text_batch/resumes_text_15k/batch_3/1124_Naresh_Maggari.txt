Description:


In RxCLAIM, when a disaster happens, each member has to call Customer Care and ask for a refill too soon override. In such circumstances Customer Care has to create a prior authorization in the system for each member who calls in. Manual intervention in handling huge call volumes is a labor intensive process and is prone to error and delays. Aetna has requested this functionality of RxCLAIM so that their members need not place a call to allow a refill during disaster circumstances.  Additionally, the MedD Team has requested similar functionality. The proposed solution to the problem outlined in Section 2.1 – Current State, is to create new screens to enter/alter disaster information and allow bypassing the Refill Too Soon edit for claims that would under normal circumstances, reject for RTS.
