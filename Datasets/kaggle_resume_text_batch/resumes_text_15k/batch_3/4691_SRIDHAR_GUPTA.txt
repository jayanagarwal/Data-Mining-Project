main PROJECT DETAILS:
                Project Name

: Layered Approach using conditional random fields for Intrusion Detection
             Software Used           :   JAVA
               Team Size
:  4
               Database
: MS-ACCESS
             Description

:Intrusion detection faces a number of challenges; an intrusion detection 




 system must reliably detect malicious activities in a network and must 
                                                     perform efficiently to cope with the large amount of network traffic. In 




 this project, we address these two issues of Accuracy and Efficiency using 



 Conditional Random Fields and Layered Approach. We demonstrate that 





 high attack detection accuracy can be achieved by using Conditional 





 random Fields and high efficiency by implementing the Layered Approach.





 Finally, we show that our system is robust and is able to handle noisy data 





 without compromising performance.
