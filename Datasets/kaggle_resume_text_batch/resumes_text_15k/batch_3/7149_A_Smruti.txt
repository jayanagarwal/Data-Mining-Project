In this project we have tried to increase data modulation rate in wireless communication 

technique. Error immunity decreases when number of user increases. This project provides 

Good Bandwidth Efficiency, Perfect modulation. It sends data in case of fading also and 

twice secured data can be send on same Bandwidth. We also were checking the 

performances of different modulation Techniques such as PSK, QPSK, 8-QAM, 16-QAM 

which is better technique for transmission of data. The project has been initiated high  

speed data rate on modulation scheme.
