· Conflict  & Dependency Check
While doing any object we mostly face issues on conflicts between the changes done in project line and production line. As the object is present and can be developed in both the lines, hence there is a chance of conflict, as changes done in both the lines especially at same time may not be in sync.

We also have issues on checking the dependancy of an object created. Since an object created can have many other objects on which it depends, We need to make sure whatever object reused are already present at the next level.
For this we need a tool which can check all the dependent object of an Object and ensure it is captured or already available in the required system.
