1. SAP BI Consolidation
The project aims at the consolidation of 6 regional + 1 stand-alone global SAP BI into 1 state of the art BI platform which could be managed by one global BI team. Due to the fragmented BW systems in the older model, it is impossible to drill down on the local, regional and global information. The new model BI aims to address these inherent short comings by focusing on LSA (Layered Scalable Architecture) model which would enable the client with a robust and consistent single point of truth, flexible, fast, easy to use, and many other capabilities to make efficient decisions to run its Pharma business. The consolidated SAP BI benefits would mean reduction in the number of reports by more than 80% (from 17000 to 2000).

The reports were produced manually. The new solution will make use of automated data preparation and consolidation as far as possible. It will combine the previous PQR and APR reports in one solution named “PQR/APR Report”. For manual content entry and completion a user interface will be developed. Also, the review and the approval of the PQR/APR reports will be handled by the application.
