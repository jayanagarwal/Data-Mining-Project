ACADEMIC PROJECT: 
Project: Integration of False Data Detection with Data Aggregation and Confidential Transmission in Wireless Sensor Networks.
Language of Implementation    
:   Visual C# .Net.

Front End  

              
:   Visual Studio.Net 2005

Operating System                      
:   Windows XP Professional. 

DESCRIPTION:

           

In This Project, In wireless sensor networks, compromised sensor nodes can distort the integrity of data by injecting false data. Previously known techniques on false data detection do not support data confidentiality and aggregation, even though they are usually essential to wireless sensor networks. However, this paper has presented the novel security protocol DAA to integrate data aggregation, confidentiality, and false data detection. DAA appends two FMACs to each data packet. To reduce the communication overhead of algorithm SDFC, the size of each FMAC is kept fixed. Each FMAC consists of sub MACs to safeguard the data against up to compromised sensor nodes. The performance analysis indicates that the computational and communication overhead of DAA is not substantial, thereby making the implementation of DAA feasible. The simulation results show that the amount of transmitted data is reduced by up to 60%, leading to a significant improvement in bandwidth utilization and energy consumption. As for the future research, we consider of enabling every sensor node to be capable of both aggregating and forwarding data in order to improve network security and efficiency.
