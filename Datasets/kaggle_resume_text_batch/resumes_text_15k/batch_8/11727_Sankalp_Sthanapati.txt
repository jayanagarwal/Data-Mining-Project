Automation Specialist
 I have worked on multiple RPA projects which were related to ticket handling. This
includes projects which required automation in client environments using Citrix as
well as secured environments.
Have developed multiple web-based applications which are being used by the
various accounts of IBM service desk. These tools help the agents in documenting
and keeping track of the cases they have worked on. In addition, they automatically
generate reports which are then distributed to the various stakeholders.
Have developed a ChatBot for the end-users of a bank to provide technical support
and can be integrated with the service desk to provide advanced phone support in
case the issue is unresolved.
Have contributed and implemented multiple ideas for process improvement leading
to savings for the company.
Had developed web-based software simulators that can mimic the client
environment, client software, and mobile devices. These helped the service desk
agents to guide the users in troubleshooting software and devices in absence of
remote assistance.
