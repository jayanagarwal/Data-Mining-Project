Title
:  
EFFICIENT ROUTING IN INTERMITTENTLY   CONNECTED MOBILE NETWORKS: THE MULTIPLE – COPY CASE 

Language
:  
JAVA
	Project Description



Intermittently connected mobile networks are wireless networks where most of the time there does not exist a complete path from source to the destination.

In this context, conventional routing schemes fail, because they try to establish complete end-to-end paths, before any data is sent.

To deal with such networks researches have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes.

Due to the drawbacks in flooding-based scheme we introduce a new family of routing schemes that “spray”  a few message copies into the network, then route each copy independently towards the destination.
