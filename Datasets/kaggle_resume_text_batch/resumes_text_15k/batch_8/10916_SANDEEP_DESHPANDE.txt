Project Engagement Overview: 
 
 
Project: 1 
 

• Name: “Data Reduction Technique” 
• Client:  INSOFE 
• Description: The data reduction procedures are of vital importance to machine learning 

and data mining. The proposed approach has been used to reduce the original dataset 
including selection of reference instances and removal of irrelevant attributes. 

• Technique: SVD, Random Forest, Clustering, PCA. 
• Team members: 3 

 
 
Project: 2 
 

• Name: “Predicting the Potential Maintenance Opportunity of Machines” 
• Client: INSOFE 
• Description: To predict whether the machine would face any possible major problems in 

the future. In this role, I was responsible for pre-processing of the data, various new features 
were created while merging of data sets and building of various models like Naïve Bayes, 
XGBoost and Random Forest.  

• Techniques: Naïve Base, Random Forest, XGBoost 
• Summary: On data preprocessing and applying various models found Naïve Base as an 

appropriate model for this potential maintenance producing the highest accuracy.

Project: 3 
 

• Name: “Employee Bill Overtime Prediction”  
• Description: To predict whether an employee will bill overtime on a project or not. In this 

role, I was responsible for pre-processing of the data and building of a classification model.  
• Techniques: Decision Tree, Rpart, Logistic Regression. 
• IDE: R Studio, Jupyter Notebook 
• Summary: On data, preprocessing and applying various models found Rpart as an 

appropriate model for this business case producing the highest accuracy.

Project: 4 
 

• Name: “SoCalGas” 
• Client: Sempra 
• Description: In this project the existing website was integrated in a webview. The native 

login page consists of username and password with finger print authentication 
integrated to it. The Google Analytics is integrated to analyse the patterns of customers 
consuming gas, managing the optimum usage and mapping feature for the nearest 
refuelling station in Southern California.
