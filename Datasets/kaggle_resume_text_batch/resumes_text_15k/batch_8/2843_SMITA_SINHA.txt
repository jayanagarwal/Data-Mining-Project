Summer Internship

Organisation: The Gateway Hotel
- A TATA Group Concern







Duration        : 8 Weeks 
Project Title   : “A study on the Drivers for Employee Engagement”
Project Description: 
During my internship I did a small research and survey on “Employee Engagement in The Gateway Hotel, Vishakhapatnam”. During my study I found that organization faces many problems like employee retention, performance level, job satisfaction etc. which brings lower productivity in the organization. This problem can be solved by the employee engagement programme. Through my study I tried to find out some key drivers such as periodical functional trainings, rewards, recognition and performance appraisal, remuneration at par with industry, good infrastructure and facilities, balance score card compensation etc, if provided to the employees can help them to get associated with the organization as well as also brings feeling of high job satisfaction within themselves. This feeling of high job satisfaction can make them work beyond the call of the duty which in return will increase organizational productivity and decrease costs as well.

 Key Learning: Decision making ability, use of HRMS, conducting small employee engagement                activities, balance score, motivation method leadership.
