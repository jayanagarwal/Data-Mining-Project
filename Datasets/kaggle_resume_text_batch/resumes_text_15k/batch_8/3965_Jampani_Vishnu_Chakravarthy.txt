Project Summary
Project #1: Wireless communication for Energy meter using cc1110 
Role: 

Development and integration
Team size: 
Two
Environment:


Programming language
:
Embedded- C.


Operation system

:
Windows.

Target Architecture

:
8051 MCU

Compiler


: 
IAR

Standard Protocols involved   :
I2C, UART, and IEEE 802.15.4 (MAC).
Project related information:

                  This is a integration  based project.  To communicate Energy Meter wirelessly, Implemented own proprietary protocol with 128-bit encryption with a maximum payload of 128 bytes, where meter handover the data through UART, then data is encrypted and then header is added  and then transmitted, After receiving that packet header is removed and de-cryptic and then handover data to meter through UART.  According to network point-to-point, star topology and Mesh topology was implemented. Network maintains can be consider based on RSSI(Received signal strength indicator) and HOP count, point to point or Mesh topology can be handled..
Responsibilities:
· Implementation of embedded software.

· Code simulation, optimization and functionality testing.
· Document for module design and implementation details.
Project #2: DLMS protocol stack for Energy meter 
Role: 

Development, integration and testing.
Team size: 
Two

Environment:


Programming language
:
Embedded- C.


Operation system

:
Windows.

Compiler


: 
IAR

Project related information:

This is a protocol based project. Studied bluebook and green book for implementation of DLMS Protocols and to understand the frame header of COSEM and HDLC. Establishing client server communication between Energy meter and system application, DLMS Protocol mainly matters in frame Timings, which has to match timeouts with system application. From UART data is taken from Energy meter and given to application, in between stack is present, which is need to add header according to DLMS protocol based on data from energy meter.
Responsibilities:
· Implementation of embedded software.

· Code simulation, optimization and functionality testing.
· Document for module design and implementation details.

Project #3: IPV6 based Wireless communication for Energy meter using              cc1310
Role: 

Development, integration and testing.

Team size: 
Two

Environment:


Programming language
:           Embedded- C.


Operation system

:          Windows & Linux.


Platform


:           ARM CortexM3, M0.

Protocols involved   

:
I2C, UART, IEEE-802.15.4, ipv6, RPL, UDP.

Project related information:

This is a integration based project. Optimized for wireless communication with meter. 6Lowpan Module which has the intelligence of handling data over ipv6 and RF (Radio frequency), Mac is IEEE 802.15.4 with payload of 128 bytes where ipv6 has a payload of 1280 bytes, to send that huge data through Mac layer (L2-Layer) is not possible, so for that adoption layer is introduced which will compress the 1280 bytes into 128 bytes by using header compression and fragmentation techniques. For Routing protocol  RPL is used which can control the whole network with four messages .Initially router will send DIS message to join into network(which will maintain at L3-Layer) ,If any Root or coordinator received DIS then Root will send DIO message (Dag information object) in response to DIO Router will send DAO .

6Lowpan protocol is a ipv6 low power handing stacks currently working with contiki-os which operates on event based os. For that we used TI CC1310 controller which has two cores , one is cortex-M3,and another is cortex- M0. For RF functionality and RF core part is handled in contex-M0. In Contex-M3 application part which was categorized into adoption layer(which is in between MAC layer (L2-Layer) and Network layer(L3-Layer), ipv6 and icmpv6,RPL(network layer) and transport layer(udp,tcp) and then application.
Responsibilities:
· Implementation of embedded software.

· Code simulation, optimization and functionality testing.
· Document for module design and implementation details.
