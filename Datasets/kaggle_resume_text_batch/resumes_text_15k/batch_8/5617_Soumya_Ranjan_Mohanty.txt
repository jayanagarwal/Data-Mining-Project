Project Title



: “Low Power SOC Architecture for Bluetooth Base band 





  Design”

Skills and Technologies Used
: Verilog HDL Programming, Blue Tooth Technology.
Project Details

Aim of the Project
· To develop a low power Bluetooth Baseband that would be flexible enough to be integrated in SOC architecture.

Project Information
· The basic operation of this project to establish a control connection between devices which form a PICONET.

· Understand the concepts of HEC, CRC, FEC, Whitening, Encryption and Security of Base band.

· The project is divided into two parts, the Bit-stream Data Path and Encryption modules.

· Designing the sub blocks of the Data Path module

· Verilog-HDL Coding of all the Data Path Module 

· RTL Simulation

· Bug Fixing

· Testing the code

· Verification
· Implementation

Project Result


· All Modules implemented and synthesized.

· The synthesized module results showed the area and speed performances.

· Good area reduction because of a design without any buffer between modules.
· Overall the entire project ended with a considerable achievement of Designing, HDL Coding, Verification and Synthesis.

Advantage
· Good speed performances, which could be seen in the synthesis result, showing that the circuit can operate at almost 40 times the required speed.
· Low power required comparing to Hardware implementation.

Disadvantage
· Encryption Module was a huge one hence done partially.

· Couldn’t cover the concept of SCATTERNET.
