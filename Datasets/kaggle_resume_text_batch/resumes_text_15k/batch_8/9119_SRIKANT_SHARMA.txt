	Project Name:
	Japanese Text Classification

	Environment
	MySql
Tools: Python, Spark,Pyspark, FacebookFast-Text, AWS EC2 Linux Instance, Putty, WinScp, Machine learning.


Project Description

Japanese text Classification of incidents as per the description in Japanese language and the segmentation. It’s hard to tokenize the Japanese words because unlike some languages like English, French there is no spaces between Japanese words. Recently launched library from Facebook Fast-Text has the ability to support different languages and the pre-trained models for 157 different languages. We have done it using Amazon AWS EC2 Linux instance and the Pyspark.

Responsibilities:

· Understanding text incident data logs structure.
· Importing the features into the CSV files
· Feeding the CSV file to EC2 instance
· Importing the Japanese trained model into EC2 Instance
· Text preprocessing to clean some of system related items.
· Training the model with the incident data
· Based on the description, segmenting the incident data
