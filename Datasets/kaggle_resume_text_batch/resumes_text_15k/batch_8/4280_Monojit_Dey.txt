Project Brief: 

COUNTRY-WIDE NETWORK FOR COMPUTERIZEDENHANCED RESERVATION AND TICKETING-developed by AGMN group, is a total networking solution to Indian Railways Passenger Reservation System. Railways will enable reservations in any train, date, or class, between any pair of stations to the traveling public on about many terminals across the country. By our AGMN RAILWAY RESERVATION SYSTEM any user can see the train’s no, train’s name, source station, destination station, source departure time & arrival time of all the important trains. They also can enquire the fares in all types of classes (2nd Class/AC etc). The system will educate the users on different types of rules and regulations, such as- NEW RULES, RESERVATION RULES, SENIOR CITIZEN’S RULES, BREAK JOURNEY RULES, LUGGAGE RULES & CIRCULAR JOUNEY RULES etc. 

For a person to make reservation in this system all he/she has to click the blink option “CLICK HERE FOR RESERVATION”, then there will come a reservation form. After filling up this form, users have to click the “SUBMIT” button. After that the user will get the train no, PNR no, ticket no & status of reservation. The user can also see and read about A.C and Luxury trains.
My Role:

In this project I have created all the static & dynamic pages. There are many static pages such as- Home Page, Rules Page, Information Page & About Us Page. These static pages have been created using HTML & Java Script & can contain HTML tags & text as well as other elements suitable for the page, such as images. User can just navigate through different pages using hyperlink present inside the web page. The dynamic web pages are Trains & Schedule page, Fare page & Reservation Form. ASP code is used for train search, fare search & reservation form page. User can go through HTML page to ASP page by the help of Action tag.
