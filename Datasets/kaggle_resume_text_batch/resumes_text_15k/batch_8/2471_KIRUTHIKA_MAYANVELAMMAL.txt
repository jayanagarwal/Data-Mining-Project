TECHNICAL SKILLS:

 Programming Languages : Basics of C, C++, PLC and SCADA.

 Operating Systems: Windows XP.

UG PROJECT:

 Title:“Simulation  and  Implementation  of  Five  Level  Inverter  With  Reduced  Switching

Techniques  for  Traction Drives”.

 Description: The  general  function of  the  multilevel  inverter  is  to  synthesize  a  desired

voltage  from several  levels  of  dc  voltages.  For  this  reason a  novel  single-phase  five-level

inverter  is   proposed   using   coupled  inductors.  This   inverter can output  five  level  voltage

with only one  dc  source. Reducing the Number of switches we are modify the  Circuit . The



new topology achieves  a  37.5%  reduction  in  the  number  of  main  power  switches  required

(five  in  the  new  against  eight  in  any  of  the  other  three  configurations)  and  uses  no  more

diodes  or  capacitors  than  the  second best  topology  in  the  literature, the  Asymmetric

Cascade configuration.
