Period:		Apr’11-Jun’11
Tools:		SPSS Package
Objective:		
· The study was taken to identify, understand and analyze the impact of various factors that affect the share prices of banks and provide suggestions to investors and broking companies on how they could protect themselves from the volatility of share market

Findings:
· H0: various factors do not affect the share prices 
· H1: various factors affect the share prices
· From the analysis it has been noted that the observed significance value is 0.000 (for all the three selected banks) which is less than the alpha value of 0.05, therefore the null hypothesis (H0) will be rejected; i.e. (0.000<0.05) which rejects the H0; by the above study could accept the alternate hypothesis and conclude that “Various factors affect the Share Prices”
