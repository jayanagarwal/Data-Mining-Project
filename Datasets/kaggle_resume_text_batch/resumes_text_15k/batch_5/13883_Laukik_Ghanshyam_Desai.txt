Academic Projects: 
1. PG diploma in Embedded system design (C-DAC) project 

Title: Benchmarking of Embedded Linux and Embedded Xenomai OS on BegleBoard XM + Trainer XM kit 
Details:  This project basically involves comparison of two OS implementations. i.e GPOS vs RTOS. 

It involved benchmarking of OS based on various time critical parameters like interrupt latency, 
scheduling jitter and mode switching overheads etc. 

 
2. Bachelor of Engineering – Academic project 

Title: Wireless Data logging at Runway using Zigbee 
Details:  In this academic project, we have built a data logger at runway for ATC. It receives 
the data from all the environmental sensors on the transmitter side kept near to runway; 
Process it, time stamps it and transmits this data to the receiver, using wireless communication link (Zigbee 
Protocol). Receiver logs the received data compares it with standard thresholds and depending upon the result, 
the controller takes the required action. It involved circuit designing, PCB drawing, programming the controllers 
(PIC18f), Zigbee wireless interface and Display & keyboard interface. 
 

3. Bachelor of Engineering – Academic  Mini-project 
Title: Digital Calendar with Timer 
Details:  We built our own Digital Calendar which used to show the day, date and time. It had alarm setup with 
two modes.(i.e. one time alarm & two time alarm.)One time alarm resembles to normal alarm but by using two 
time alarm we could set a custom action for particular duration. It involved circuit designing, PCB drawing, 
Microcontroller programming, RTC, Display, keyboard, Buzzer and ROM interfacing 
Platform: Hardware Platforms (8051 Microcontroller)
