M.TECH. D ISSERTATION/ MASTER THESIS: 

 Title:  Analysis & Optimization of Yarn Room Inventory, A Case Study at Raymond’s Textile Mill, 
Chhindwara. 

 Details: The Chhindwara unit of Raymond Ltd. is the largest in capacity out of its three plants. It 
produces 45000 meter fabric per day. The plant was facing a problem of over weighted 
inventory of yarn. The Inventory had capacity of 180 M.T. but it contained 270 M.T. means 90 
M.T. was the exceeded inventory volume. I analyzed the problem in detail and suggested some 
solutions to overcome from the problem. The draft of my thesis is based on HML analysis and 
FIFO method.
