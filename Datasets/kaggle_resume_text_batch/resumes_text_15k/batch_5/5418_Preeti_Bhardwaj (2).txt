Description:
This software is a Financial Mortgage Application Software for North View Group (NVG). Mortgage solution comes in 2 flavors:

Origination Solution -- Basically deals with loan account creation.

Servicing Solution    -- It deals with all the servicing part that can be done with an existing loan account.
Currently we develop only Origination part for this client. This client provides first charge loans to the customers. My part on this project is gathering information, development and maintenance of different module based on client requirement. I am also involved in deploying the changes to server and packaging for client release.

Normally origination has 3 main steps: 

KFI (Key facts illustration)- An applicant can generate multiple KFI's with multiple lenders, can compare their products and go for the best option for him in terms of interest rate, EMI and other facilities.
DIP(Decision in principle)- In case of DIP; Credit history, employment details, commitment details, existing mortgage details, rental details of the applicant is checked and decision is given whether the loan can be approved or not.
FMA(Full mortgage application)- Once DIP is accepted, the applicant can go for full mortgage solution, in which he has to mention his property details, valuation details, solicitor details etc.
