Project Description:
This is an internal project of Bank of America. We provided the support for the merchants who use Bank of America as their authorizer for their transactions. 

Mainframe- Merchants have their jobs running on Mainframe LPAR, for which we use to monitor them and if in case they fail, abend recovery is used to make sure the jobs are running smoothly. Settlement files which are not received in time as expected by bank are been tracked using TSO-Tran Trac and follow up with merchant or the NDM-FTP team is done to make sure if the file will be received in Time or not. If not, then what will be the ETA? 

Using CA7 to perform various functions like Scheduling of the Job Cycles and Job instances which includes- Adding Conditions to the job (so that job can wait on these conditions before coming into the queue or before coming into the Active queue), Adding Predecessors and successors to the job which may affect the job scheduling and the way the job comes into the CA7 queue. 
Performing ARF- the recovery procedures, which can be followed up by the system in case job fails, Maintaining the resources (RM), which the job is using, in order to make sure that the job stream finishes in time specified for it. 

Apart from the job failures and late files, weekly IPL-Sysmod is performed by the Operations (Sysops), which we are. During Sysmod, jobs are run during before the IPL begins, Back up jobs are run and then initiators are drained. After IPL, initiators are brought back up and jobs will run smoothly.

Batch Job Scheduling on CA-7 and TSO as per the request coming from Merchants or the Transaction Team.

Taking care of the CA7 job queue time to time to make sure the batch job cycle is running with in the SLA time (Tbred Cycle).

Midrange- Merchants have their stations with Bank on which different transactions happens. Our duty is to monitor those stations using Tandem by logging into different CAIL sessions (ATSP1, ATSP2, and KY6PSS). 
If any of the station goes down, alert is populated on the Tandem and TBSM and the merchant owning that station will be informed. Action will be taken according to the standard procedures of Bank.
Different actions like – Key Change for Network and Fire call ID activation as per the request or need.

We are first point of contact for any issue on Mainframe and Tandem; tickets are opened for the issues as per the Bank standards.
Working along with US team as Merchant Domain Sysops.
