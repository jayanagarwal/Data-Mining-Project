Automatic Commercial Detector                                                  Cerebroz EduTree LLP 
Objective: We are developing commercial detection, which will notifies user whenever 
any Commercial block is display in the TV stream. 
Role: Researcher, Programmer 
Tools and Technology: Python, C++, Machine Learning, OpenCV3.3.0 
 

Automatic Channel Detector                                                         Cerebroz EduTree LLP 
Objective: Automatic Channel Detector as name suggest detects the currently running 
channel in the TV. We used Supervised Machine Learning for classification of channel 
using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Using OpenCV3.3.0 we pre-process the video 
frames and to reduce the computation we used Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) 
to extract the features from the video frame. Our SVM model gave 98% accuracy and 
detect proper channel.  
Tools and Technology: C++, Machine Learning (SVM), HOG, OpenCV3.3.0 
 

Automatic Fracture Detection with analytics       (5th & 6th Semester Project, MCA)
