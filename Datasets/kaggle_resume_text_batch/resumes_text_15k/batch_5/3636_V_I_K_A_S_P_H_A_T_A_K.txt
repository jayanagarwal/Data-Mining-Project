Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) using time series analysis and LSTM for Damodar Valley Corporation 
 Load forecasting engine was designed to support decision making such as unit commitment, reducing spinning 

reserve, economic dispatch and maintenance scheduling. 

 This engine deals with the forecasting from 15 minutes to 1 week.  

 Data from Regional SCADA systems, Weather stations was used as primary data sources. 

 Final model was built and deployed on historical data server using python and oracle stored procedures 

Load shedding and restoration recommendation system for Powergrid India Ltd (Eastern Grid) 
 Load shedding and restoration recommendation system was designed to identify areas where power can be 

shedded in situations such as power shortage, low frequency in grid, excessive loads causing instability in grid. 

 Model was designed to recommend loads that can be shedded without creating power swings and electrically 

isolated islands. 

 Model was designed in such a way that it can recommend restorations when system reaches to normal 

operating conditions. 

 Data from real-time power monitoring systems, optimal powerflow simulator and energy management 

systems was used to build the model. 

 Model was deployed using python and c along with SCADA system where real time status of power loads, 

breaker statuses and grid frequency is available 

Predictive Maintenance model for toothbrush manufacturing facility of Oral-B 
 Predictive maintenance model was developed to diagnose manufacturing lines in real-time to ensure heath of 

equiments. 

 Historical data from process historians and real-time sensors data from control system were used as to detect 

possible anomalies in the normal behavior of equipments 

 The incipient detection of anomalies improved mean time between failures up to 240 minutes. 

Centerlining process model for diapers manufacturing facility 
 Centerline process model was developed to make sure that the manufacturing system runs the same way all of 

the time. 

 Historical production data was used to find out important variables and best operating conditions 

 Real-time dashboard was developed to monitor process variability. 

 Centerline model helped to eliminate the need of quality checks on each manufactured diaper which reduced 

inefficient testing of high volume manufactured product like diaper without compromising the consistency in 

the product quality. 

 System reduced the annual operating cost by 5% and helped to improve overall equipment effectiveness
