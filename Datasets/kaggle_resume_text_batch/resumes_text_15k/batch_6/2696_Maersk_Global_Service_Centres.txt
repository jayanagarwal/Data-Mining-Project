Remittance project for Kenya and Tanzania customer’s.

Previously the remittance advice was only for the vendors. In Kenya and Tanzania we were having the chaque payment process but then we have moved to online transfer (NEFT) payment. According to this new process the customer’s will get their deposit money directly in their mentioned bank account.
So we have started updating the bank details of the customer in our system i.e. SAP.

In the beginning customer’s were not ready to give their bank details due to security reasons but then we have assured them how this online transfer process will help them and how it is a time saving for them. Then the customer has started providing their bank details, which we were updating in our system and the money is directly getting transferred in their given bank account. 

             But then we have started facing this new challenge that the customer was receiving the money in their account but don’t know against which shipment they have received the money. As in Kenya and Tanzania most the freight forwarders are doing the business with Maersk Line so they don’t have any idea against which shipment they have received the money. To resolve this issue we have started working on this remittance project which was previously only for the vendors. Once the pay run happens the customer will receive a remittance advice in a standard PDF format along with all the details like what is the final amount of refund, what are the deductions from the deposit and against which shipment the customer is receiving the money.
