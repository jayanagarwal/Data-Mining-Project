With a master’s degree in Commerce I’m 

looking to build my career in a progressive 

organization in a leading position, which will 

provide me with exiting opportunities to utilize 

my skills in such a way to add more value to 

the organization and enhance my knowledge 

about banking and the financial markets.   It 

takes highly motivated and results driven 

manager who has a few years of invaluable 

experience in developing a small business to 

work in a high functioning corporate 

environment. Skilled in numerous financial 

and accounting fields, including: preparing 

budgets, monitoring key corporate accounts 

and credit control. Managed several projects 

and collaborations in parallel, planned work to 

achieve goals and targets on time, set realistic 

objectives, developed creative solutions to 

problems. Being a 23 year old PhD prospect 

working in a busy high volume environment 

driven consistently by ambition and pressure, 

it takes a truly focused individual to ensure 

the efficient running of an organization. A 

person who can provide sound financial advice 

to those who need it, a person capable of 

identifying areas of cost cutting and 

improvement. Ensuring all financial controls 

for the division are met and adhered to at all 

time and guaranteeing all goals and 

assignments are completed before time.
