Mortgage process: REO property Default valuation

Default valuations play the role to fill the gap between an AVM(Automated Valuation Model and is typically referred to as a report that estimates the value of a property based on historical data of properties and projection of property values) and a field valuation product to increase processing speed but add a level of diligence in the valuation process. A primary advantage of a default valuation is the ability of a professional review appraiser in identifying the most relevant comparables.

Our default valuation combines an analysis of local market sales and subject property information by a review appraiser and CMA broker with data provided through automated valuation model.
An in-house review appraiser and CMA broker researches comparable market data from a variety of public data sources.
The most comparable sales and listing are selected and entered into our default valuation program. Positive and negative adjustments are calculated for differences between the subject and the comparable sales; net/gross adjustment percentages and the final adjusted values are provided for a clear understanding of how the final value was derived.
