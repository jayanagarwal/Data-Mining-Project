Delivery Experience: 

 
Project: Customer analytics - Risk reduction with merchants 

 

The aim of this project is to check the risk associate with the merchants to whom loan has given and to reduce the risk with 

each merchants for business growth 

Back Ground: 
➢ Performed exploratory analysis 

➢ Performed Feature Engneering- Creted additional variables from the available features 

➢ Performed text analytics to generate geographical information and keywords that helps in analysizing the pattern 

➢ Generated a model  that helps in identifying the probability of merchants  associated risk. 

Models used 

➢ Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Multiple linear Regression, Text Analytics 

 

Project : HR Analytics  

 

Back Ground: 

➢ Human resource analytics (HR analytics) is an area in the field of analytics that refers to applyinganalytic processes to 
the human resourcedepartment of an organization in the hope of improving employe performance and therefore getting 

a better return on investment. 

➢ Project Objective: 

• We want to understand why valuable employees leave. 

• We want to predict who will leave next. 

• Models used 

Decision tree,  Random Forest, Regression, Text Analytics

Project: Very Low Resolution Face Recognition using Fused Visual and Texture Feature 

The project deals with recognizing  of multiple images whose resolution is very low and it is very challenging due to 

availability of very low informations.. 

• Accountable for creating business case out of an image  

• Applied deep learning techniques to classify  images 

• Georgia Tech Database use for experimental purpose. 
Models Used: 

• mDCT, GLCM, FFNN, K-NN, PCA, GMM
