Educational Data Science Projects:

1. Diabetes Development Prediction- HEALTHCARE ANALYTICS
Overview:  Client wants to develop machine learning model to predict patients developing diabetes. 
Trained data sets using Naive Bayes, Random Forest and finally chosen to develop a model using Logistic regression in python Scikit-learn library.
Confusion matrix, Classification report are used to evaluate prediction and an accuracy of >70% is achieved.
Environment: Machine Learning, Python Pandas, Matplot-lib
Models: Logistics Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes 

2. Project on Bank Loan Approval 
Overview: Client wants to find to which customers they should sanction loan and to how much amount they can sanction to the individual.
The client has provided the customer details (like occupation, savings, Cibil score..etc).
Models: Logistics Regression, Decision tree, Random forest
