I developed an online drug target database (http://puneet.tk/file.php) that had preprocessed data

from a pipeline developed by me that analyzed known drug compounds with target proteins that cause

NREM (Non-Rapid Eye movement) sleep disorders in particular to a syndrome known as Narcolepsy.

Results analysed where uploaded into an online website which enables other Bioinformaticians, Bio-

clinicians and Industry Experts to conduct further investigations in laboratory. The Website functions

using PHP and JavaScript for backend and HTML, CSS as front end for users to view analyzed

information that is available free of charge without paying for analysis for the above diseases and

further conduct laboratory explorations
