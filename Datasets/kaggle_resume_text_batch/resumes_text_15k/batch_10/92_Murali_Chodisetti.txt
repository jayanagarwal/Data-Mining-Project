Projects: 
 
Done in: Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland (HIPS), Germany.  

Duration: February, 2013 – July, 2014. 

 

Title:  Continuous benchmarking of genome assemblers: the AssemblaTest tool. 

Description: Built a pipeline tool called AssemblaTest for continuous testing of prokaryotic genome 

assemblies. The downstream analysis is more challenging and one has to spend a lot of time to 

understand and analyze the data. The accuracy estimation module produces the results of error rate, 

genome coverage and unmapped ratio based on analysis of metrics. Our AssemblaTest tool can be 

used for benchmarking genome assemblers performance on your own high-throughput datasets. The 

data analysis results showed Spades assembler is more accurate followed by Velvet assembler.  

 

Tools: Python, R, Velvet, Mira, Soapdenovo, Spades, Bowtie2, Samtools.
