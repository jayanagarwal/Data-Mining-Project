PROJECT DETAILS

Title               : Reverse Wheel Locking Mechanism For Automobile

Description   : The project work consists of automobile related problems faced on gradients such as windings in
Ghats and hills etc and in order to reduce the manual work which may prove to be hectic and
time consuming and handling accelerator, brake and clutch along with hand brake is only
possible for highly skilled driver. Hence the project work aim on focusing on minimizing the
manual efforts and making mechanical tool kit to have comfortable and traffic free ride.
The project consists of locking the reverse wheel such that it will constraint the reverse motion of
the vehicle with the help of ratchet and pawl mechanism. The movement of the pawls will be
controlled with the help of the linear actuators. A push button will be provided on steering of the
vehicle which will be operated by the driver on choice.
