M.Pharm Dissertation Work

Title             : “Development and Validation of Methods for Estimation of Active Drug   


             Ingredients in Pharmaceutical Formulation.” 

Guide           : Dr. Sagar B. Wankhede.
Summary     : Three UV spectrophotometric methods (viz. Simultaneous Equation, Area Under

                        Curve, Multicomponent Mode) as well as RP-HPLC and HPTLC methods have
                        been developed for simultaneous estimation of Atorvastatin calcium and

            Metoprolol succinate in capsule dosage form. Developed methods were validated

            as per ICH guidelines.
