	Technical tools
	· OS: Ubuntu, Platform: Net Beans.  
· Language: C++, Simulator: Gazebo 3D.

	Description
	This Dissertation is going to use artificial intelligence (AI) and the concept of informed search algorithm (A*) to find the minimum cost and time for a particular task in a real life scenario. We just work on an A* algorithm to find the informed path and Path planning is a classical problem of robotics field. The robot will traverse through the path to reach the goal. This technique will implement and tested in real world experiments and simulated. Our technique is to work with this A* algorithm is integrated on a gazebo 3D simulator for a particular robot or multiple robots to be chosen a best shortest path.
