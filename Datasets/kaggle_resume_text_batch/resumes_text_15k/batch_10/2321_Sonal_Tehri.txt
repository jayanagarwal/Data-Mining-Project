But before implementing this huge migration, they wanted to understand the market to target at. Our Team helped them understand the attributes and their aimed market in a better way through statistical techniques. For this, we built a highly functional Propensity Model to understand the association between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The project was a cross sell product as the main aim is to raise the current revenue coming from users.
Skillset Utilized:  Base SAS, Base SAS programming, Base SAS procedures, Data insights, Data cleansing (Missing value and Outlier Treatment), Data Manipulation (Dummy Variable creation), Variable Reduction using Information Value and Weight of Evidence, Regression and VIF technique to detect multi collinearity, Stratified Sampling, Variable selection using stepwise approach of Logistic Regression, Predictive Modelling, Computing Scores using Maximum Likelihood Estimators & Area Under Curve (MLE & AUC).

Roles, Responsibilities and Achievements
1. Working with the UK based communication provider, British Telecommunications plc, to understand the business.

2. Using statistical approach such as Logistic Regression on SAS to predict which customers will adopt the latest emerging technology.
