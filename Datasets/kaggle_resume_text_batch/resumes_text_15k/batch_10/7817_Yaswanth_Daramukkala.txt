Kaggle & Pilot Projects:
Project: To develop a model to predict the propensity of a consumer committing fraud at the underwriting stage for unsecured business loan product
Tools used: - R and SQL
Approach: - After initial data exploration and significant features in the dataset were found out, business ratios helped to better understand the depth of the problem, like FOIR, DSCR, D/E, LTV etc. Variable Scoring concept was used for better implementation. Logistic Regression was applied for better accuracy.

Project: To develop predictive model to improve Automation Index for testing projects 
Tools used: - R and Tableau
Approach: - After finding the multiple factors influencing the automation index, we applied Multiple Linear regression was applied for better equation.

Project: To develop predictive model to improve Productivity for testing projects 
Tools used: - R and Tableau
Approach: - After finding the multiple factors influencing the Productivity for Design and Execution, we applied Multiple Linear regression was applied for better equation. We derived two separate equations for Design and Execution

Critical Data Migration  Projects worked on
· Bank Mutual Merger and Acquisition: As part of the Bank Mutual M&A project, we had to review the Bank Mutual products, applications, business processes etc. for integration to Associated Bank systems and processes. This includes however not limited to application mapping, product mapping, customer profiling, data mapping and migration of 100K+ account data and 200K+ customer profile data to 50+ Associated Bank systems, conversion of 70K debit card and 40K online banking profiles etc.
· Associated Connect to Universal Online Banker (UOB): Associated Connect is Online banking Platform for Associated Bank which will be Migrated to Universal Online Banker application. As part of Migration testing, we are validating the data from Source to destination and also perform regression testing between interface applications.
· Business Banking Service Provider: As part of this project, we have create a model which can analyse the Type of Business Services that can be offered to any specified Client based on the set of conditionalities and to suggest whether the Client can be offered with requested Services or not. The Services may include like Positive pay, ACH Services and Loan Limits etc.
Responsibilities:
· To understand the Business problem and interact with the client on regular basis to get more and deep insight of the data shared by the client
· To find out the outliers in the data and use statistical concepts to study the effect of these outliers on the given data
· Developed in house tools for Data Analysis (Data Health Check, Data Mapping and Data Load) using VB Script 
· Perform Cross Browser and Mobile testing using Sauce labs
· Develop end to end traceability matrix of online banking profile migration to ensure that no profile is dropped
· Mentor the offshore team containing Data Analysis and functional resources 
· Document the test results in HP Application Lifecycle Management and ensure all the requirements are covered
· Review the test artifacts with client and ensure there is no gap in requirements coverage
· Prepare the daily and weekly project status report and send it to project stakeholders
· Prepare the test closure report at the end of a project and send it to project stakeholders
