The transport was very mismanaged especially in terms of shuttle pickup. I was planning to leave after completing 1 year however in NOV 2017 I met with an accident while travelling to office in their cab as it was a late night shift. I had rest for 3 – 4 months as I suffered shoulder dislocation & fracture. Unfortunately they weren’t able to accommodate leaves after January, hence on February 14th 2018 I took an emergency exit to get completely cured due to which I am completely fit now.
