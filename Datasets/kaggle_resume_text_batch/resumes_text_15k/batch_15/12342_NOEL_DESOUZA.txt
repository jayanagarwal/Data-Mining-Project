Why Editing 

Growing up, I was always intrigued in the intricacies of English. 

Coupled with my love for reading, I realized that I look out for errors 

subconsciously. Be it newspapers, spoken dialogue, or even books, I 

always unknowingly keep my eyes and ears open and find errors. With 

this skillset, I hope to forge a career in the field of editing.
