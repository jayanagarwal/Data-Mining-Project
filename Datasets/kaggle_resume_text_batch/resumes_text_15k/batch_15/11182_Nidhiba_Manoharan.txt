ACADEMIC	PROJECTS

USER	IDENTIFICATION	ACROSS	MULTIPLE	SOCIAL	NETWORKS
DESCRIPTION	:			

															Today	it	is	common	that	people	are	users	of	more	than	one	social	
network	having	their	virtual	identities	in	Networks	like	Facebook	,LinkedIn	etc.
This	project	aims	at	enhancing	the	search	algorithm	for	finding	a	particular
profile.To	acheive	this	the	method	implemented	is	PROFILE	MATCHING.
We	collect	data	from	two	popular	social	networks	to	study	the	similarity	of	
profile	definition.We	evaluate	the	importance	of	fields	in	the	web	profile	and
develop	a	profile	comparison	tool.	We	demonstrate	the	effectiveness	and	
efficiency	of	our	tool	in	identifying	and	consolidating	duplicated	users	on	
different	websites.

EYE	CHECKUP	WEBSITE:
DESCRIPTION	:
		
														Many	people	don't	have	their	eyes	tested	regularly;	only	this	can	
ensure	that	we	can	always	benefit	from	optimum	vision.After	all,	our	eyes,
and	hence	our	vision,	are	subject	to	a	process	of	constant	change	as	we
get	older,	and	this	often	goes	unnoticed.The	first	sign	that	our	vision	is	
deteriorating	is	not	always	blurred	or	unfocused	vision.	Headache	or	eye
strain	in	the	evening	could	also	indicate	defective	vision.Hence	this	project	
was	developed	for	vision	tests	which	provides	the	user	with	instant	results
that	help	him	/	her	do	self-analysis	about	their	vision.
