Project Description:
HCM:
The main intent of Workday integration with Symantec internal systems is to provide the updated employee information for all the internal systems to use it in their applications. Workday EAI Interface will be designed to accommodate future flexibility and scalability of HR Activities for next 5 years which may include M&A of a company of similar size i.e. doubling up the number of employees. All the outgoing requests to workday will send through EAI middleware using SOAP/HTTPS. The workday will push the files for CDM Publisher and IR interface using SFTP protocol and also the files will be encrypted using the PGP algorithm.
For file based processing, Workday will push the data files on to Symantec external file server using SFTP protocol. Tibco will keep polling for new files and it will start processing the files as soon as it finds a new file on the server. EAI will transfer the file from External FTP server to the internal EAI server using SFTP protocol and then it will decrypt the file. Once the file is decrypted, it will read the data in sequence and send it to the downstream systems. Once the file is read and exhausted, it will be deleted from the local EAI server and then archived from the External FTP server
