Project 2:            June 2016 to till Date 

 Name of Project: VISP (Verizon Internet Services Platform) 

Team Size: 4  

Language: C, C++, Java, Python, Go 

Project Description:  

VISP Service Control Platform (VSCP, aka QueenBEE) is heart of VISP Internet service realization and 

orchestration. 

The first is to host business application servers such as customer on-boarding and TFD service 

management application servers that are accessible by customers from the Internet through VSDP to on-

board, add credits, create/modify/delete/start/stop TFD service instances, access service statistics etc. 

The second role of VSCP is to provide centralized VISP service control services to VSEPs in the network 

to orchestrate VISP server enforcement. This includes VISP service rule management service to manage 

and distribute service rules to VSEPs and VISP service quota management service to account quota 

installed for service instances and distribute them to VSEPs as needed. 

The last role of VSCP is to collect and provide VISP service statistic to customers via service portal 

application server. 

Role: 

 Developed test cases, prepared test plans. 

 Executed Sanity, Regression and Non-functional test cases. 

 Automated regression test cases using robot framework. 

 Monitoring Defect tracking Process Using Jira/Bugzilla.

Since Jan 2013 – Jan 2016: Software – Intellinet Technologies 

Project 1:            Dec 2014 to 31 Jan 2016 

 Name of Project: Inter Working Function (IWF) 

Team Size: 4  

Language: C, C++, Java, Python 

Project Description:  

The IWF is a 3GPP compliant Diameter to SS7 IWF (interworking function) that enables legacy solutions 

to be extended to LTE and IMS networks. It’s a complete package that can be deployed in stand-alone 

mode. 

Offering configurable control of Diameter interfaces, including S6a, RO and more, it provides a critical 

link between 2G, 3G and Fixed infrastructure with LTE and IMS networks. It solves interoperability 

issues and enhances ROI, by protecting investments and enabling new service opportunities. 

Role: 

 Developed test cases, prepared test plans. 

 Executed Sanity, Regression and Non-functional test cases. 

 Monitoring Defect tracking Process Using Jira/Bugzilla. 

 Managed all test cases using TestLink. 

 Being a Part of Automation Team for executing Test cases automatically.

Team Size: 6 

Language: C, C++, Java, Python 



Project Description:  

Diametriq's Diameter Signaling Controller offers an exceptional suite of DSC solutions, the Diameter 

Solution Suite™ (DSS).  Diametriq’s application enabled platform includes a Diameter Routing 

Agent (DRA), a Diameter Load Balancer (DLB), Diameter Edge Agent (DEA), and a Diameter 

Interworking Function (IWF).  These functions can be configured to meet your specific network 

requirements as well as serve as a host for critical applications that utilize the information contained in 

Diameter messages.
