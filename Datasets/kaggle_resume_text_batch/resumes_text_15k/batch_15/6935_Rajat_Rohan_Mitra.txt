Brief of Key Analytics projects handled :
Claims fraud model:
· Predictive fraud model was developed and implemented which provided the likeliness for an early claim to be fraudulent. The challenge faced by the organization was that  it was receiving around 700 early claims on a monthly basis and finding out fraud was completely based on human judgment and experience. This resulted in erroneous payouts or large number of cases being sent for investigation which in turn increased the cost .  The model classified the policies into 'High','Medium' and 'Low' risk on the basis of which cases are sent for investigation. This helped the company in reducing the cost of investigation by 2.5 crores.

Risk score model
· A predictive model was developed to aid in underwriting. This model was developed with the intention of finding out the probability of early death claim at the underwriting stage. High, medium and low risk levels were categorized and actions were being taken based on the risk level. The same model is being used for already issued cases within three years in order to find out likely cases of frauds and probable early claims.  Sample investigations are done for selected cases. 

Marketing Analytics- Cross Selling and campaign management: 
· A cross selling model was developed to identify existing customers who can be sold additional products. The model was built to  find out whom to sell (potential customers), what to sell[ products], and how much to sell [ticket size]. For each customer, model gave the probability of purchase for each of the product and ticket size categories. Policy level data, customer level data and campaign management data were used for model building.  The output of this model was manifold. At the organization level, relevant products per customer was found out. Based on this, target campaigns were launched which yielded a better ROI than what was noticed previously. The model also helped in identifying customer product needs and right product mapping for customers.

Renewal analytics model
· Renewals predictive model was developed to improve renewal collections and customer retention. The model predicted the propensity to pay and categorized policies into 'red', 'amber' and 'green' buckets. It helped in having differential strategies for different buckets bringing down call center cost and improving renewals. With the implementation of this model renewal persistency improved significantly, also cost optimization happened at call center with 145% increase in calling base, expenses increased by only 16%.

Retention analytics
· Retention prediction model was developed for predicting the policies which might get canceled within one year. Creating a strategy for preventing the policies from being canceled through engagement with customers. 
· A model was developed to have an early prediction (1 year in advance) for inforce policies that are at the risk of surrender. Ensemble technique (Gradient boosting and random forest) were used to arrive at the prediction model. Separate models were developed for ULIP and Non-ULIP surrenders. Surrender risk buckets were created for very high, high, medium, low and very low probabilities.

Email segregation through text analytics:
· Auto segregation of emails received from customers by text analytics  into complex queries and queries . Complex queries consists of  probable complaints and critical queries that might become a complaint if not attended urgently. It helped in decreasing the TAT of resolution as well as improving customer delight. 

Clustering of sales person:
· In order to measure the performance of Business development managers(BDM) and categorize them into various groups, clustering was done on number of parameters which are significant from company’s perspective and have direct or indirect link to the dashboard parameters. 
· BDMs are categorized into ‘Excellent’, ‘moderate’ and ‘below expectation’. This is helping the management to focus on the BDMs which are ‘ below expectation’ resulting in faster improvement.
