· Minor Project: “PULSING THIRD BRAKE LIGHT SYSTEM”

Worked on the project and successfully completed it on April 2010. It is basically used in all automobiles for safety at Highways. It covered Analog Electronics. This can be used for the purpose of safety equipment, there is a brake light with flasher .when brake is applied along with the brake light third brake light start flashing with the desired pulse you want
·  Major Project : “GSM ROBOT” 

Worked on the project and successfully completed it on April 2011. Microcontroller based Land Rover that works on the DTMF tones that are generated by a Cell phone and transmitted via GSM communication system. It covered Analog & Digital Electronics, Embedded System and Mobile Communication Conventionally; wireless-controlled robots use RF circuits, which have the drawbacks of limited working range, limited frequency range and limited control. Use of a mobile phone for robotic control can overcome these limitations. It provides the advantages of robust control, working range as large as the coverage area of the service provider, no interference with other controllers and up to twelve controls. 

In this project, the robot is so controlled by a mobile phone that makes a call to the mobile phone attached to the robot. In the course of a call, if any button is pressed, a tone corresponding to the button pressed is heard at the other end of the call. This tone is called ‘dual tone multiple frequency’ (DTMF) tone. The robot perceives this DTMF tone with the help of the phone stacked in the robot and it moves.
