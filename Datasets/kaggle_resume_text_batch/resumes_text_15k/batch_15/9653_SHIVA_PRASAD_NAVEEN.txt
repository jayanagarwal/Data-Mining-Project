Professional Experience:
Client            : Cyient Ltd.,         						Apr- 2016 to Present
Designation : Senior Telecom  Engineer
Project	         : AT&T (USA)
Software       : Auto CAD, BstCAD (Microstation), G Tech, O-Calc-Pro, MapSite&LiDAR

AT&T is the leading Telecom giant in USA; we at Cyient received the onshore and offshore work which is described below in detail:
The overall goal FTTP build is to supply fibers for all residential living units and businesses in the prescribed Distribution Area (PON Serving Area-PSA) to ensure that when a customer orders service that the order can be processed, dispatched and installed in a timely manner. This includes the placement of Drop-Pipe (inner duct material) structure from the FST to private property lot lines at the correct location for the Installation Technician to be able to use as a path for fiber drop placement and avoid future delays in installation of service to customers.
Fiber for future services should be extended to business locations where property owner permission is given for cable and terminal placement. All business addresses fed by the fiber terminal will be uploaded into Granite via AOTX as part of the project. Business locations that are copper drop fed will be served via an FST and fiber drop(s). If permission is not granted, a splice, future splice loop, or tether point is to be left for future extensions to the business location and should be placed in a workable/ accessible location for that business/building location.
Description: The objective of the project is to build a fiber network from cabinet to homes (FTTh). The project involved field survey, plan, design, propose the cabinet, trench route and conduits as per lay-plan and capturing fibre cables with FST with specifications as specified in the PM-Tool document provided for a particular area by the end client (AT&T).
Role & Responsibilities:
· Extracting the new Land Base from customer provided GIS sites.
· Modify / capture the existing telecom data (copper / fiber) with the land base using conflation tools (Trushift)
· Plan and Design the High level Design (HLD) for the required area.
· Determining the size of the fiber cables and size of FST’s as per the living units that are being served from the respective PFP in this PON serving area (in HLD design).
· Utilization of fibre cables (24F, 48F, 72F, 144F, etc.) based upon the field requirement.
· Performing Low Level Design (LLD) / detail design after receiving the confirmation and acceptance on the HLD from the Client.
· Quality Check (QC) on the LLD design.
· Preparing the deliverable such as Bill of Materials and Quantities, Cost of labour, Schematics, Work Prints based on the LLD design as per the customer requirement.
Another scope of work is of Pole Loading – we have received the survey sheets and Poles picture and the BST Cad design file. We perform the inventory task and identify where these poles are actually located by referring to the Google Maps. With the provided inputs, we design the Pole (in O-Cal Pro) with all the equipment’s (including the Anchor & Guy), attachments and cables (Power, CATV & ATT). Upon completing this task, we would check the sustainability of the pole. If the pole is sustaining the load after placing all the equipment’s and cables then we simply generate the report and deliver to the customer (*.pplx, Pro-Pole Loading) or else we propose a remedy by proposing an new Anchor & Guy to the pole to gain the sustainability to support all the features proposed / attached. (Inventory, Catalog, 3D View/Charts/Measure, Capacity, Data Entry, To View)
Role & Responsibilities:
· Creating the new project for a particular pole in O-Cal Pro.
· Select the “Load case” of the area where pole exits.
· Define the pole height, class and number.
· Place the existing field cables (Power, CATV & AT&T) on the pole with appropriate equipment’s attached with them.
· Place the entire remaining field existing equipment’s (Transformers, PIN’s, Streetlight and Insulator’s) on the pole.
· Generate the pole sustainability report and verify that all the existing attachments are mounted / captured in the pole design.
