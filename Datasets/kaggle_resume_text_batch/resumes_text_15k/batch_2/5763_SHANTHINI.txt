Professional Experience

PRODUCT 1 # LAPS - LOS: 
LAPS Retail can outsmart any lending solution in processing an individual loan. The basic details of the application are obtained from the applicant. Depending on these details the application is sanctioned or rejected with reference to details that have been parameterised by the lending institute in the dynamic setup of LAPS.

LAPS also capture the information of borrowers, co-borrowers and guarantors.  LAPS capture the details of proposed asset dynamically based on the retail product.Attaching scanned copies of related documents are made easier avoiding hazardous handling of physical documents.

Workflow is a high spot of LAPS in which the application can be routed to the officials of different levels in an organisation structure electronically, avoiding physical transfer, and hence reducing the time taken in decision making. The application can be sent to the specific user with their recommendation, or remarks. These applications will be received in the inbox of the user and can be processed further. If an application is pending with a user beyond a defined duration then an alert message will be sent to the user and to the immediate supervisor of the user automatically. 

All MIS reports and statutory reports can be generated in LAPS.  LAPS supports converting the reports into different formats like PDF, word, excel etc. LAPS are highly adaptive to any type of interface, online or offline. LAPS connect to external interface like CIBIL, CRISIL, ECGC, Terrorist list etc.   Using LAPS the turnaround time (TAT) for any loan application is significantly reduced and many applications can be effectively and quickly processed.
