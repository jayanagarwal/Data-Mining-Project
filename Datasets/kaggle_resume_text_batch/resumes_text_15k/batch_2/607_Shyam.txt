PROJECTS SUMMARY:


Project Title	: Customer Life Cycle Analysis
Role		: Data Scientist
Technologies	: R,Python,SQL,Unix,Tableau and Oracle DB 
Business object:To define and communicate the stages through which a customer progresses when considering, purchasing and using products.

1. Built the various statistical models throughout the customer journey (CART and Logistic regression).
2. To reduce the variables used various variable reduction techniques (PCA, VIF, Information value)
3. Extensively built model for in life customers, out of commitment customers and out of bundle customers.
4. Built various models for individual and Enterprise level.


Built the X-Sell and Up-Sell Model for Enterprise level customers (by using Logistic regression and CHAID)
Exploratory Data analysis for Billing and Complaints Data
Objective: Identify the drivers for Billing and complaints data.

Roles and Responsibility:

· Identify the key metrics for Billing and complaints data (Usage information, Roaming information, network information)
· Did data sanity check (Missing values and Outliers data)
·  Created univariate analysis for all the key metrics
· Created various data patterns for Billing and complaints data
· Applied Cohort analysis to understand customer movement from month on month
· Identified relation between categorical variables by using Chi-Square test.
· Identified relation between numeric variables by using the correlation techniques
· Applied various Anova methods to finding relation between the variables
· Created multi variate analysis for few variables
· Generated reports for monthly and quarterly for all key metrics variables



Project Title	: Identify the NPS (Net Promoter Score) By Using Text Mining Analysis			
Role		: Big Data Analyst
Technologies	: Python, NLP, SQL


1. Finding out Customer or Agent Name By using Web Chats
2. Identifying positive and negative words from the web chats.
3. Identify most frequent or repeated words.
4. Identifying credit amount from web chats.
5. Extensively using the NPS score in Python.








Project Title    	: Propensity model for customer response model					
Role	             : Data Scientist
Technologies	 : R, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Oracle
Business object: We would like to build a propensity model, who will respond for a product.

Responsibilities:
· Phase1:Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Features scaling and Features engineering.
· Performed Data sanitization, Missing value treatment, outlier treatment.
· Phase 2: Created Dummy variables for Categorical variables and done the Binning variable creation for Continuous variables.
· Performed Statistics -Descriptive statistics, Hypothesis testing, ANOVA.
· Performed feature selection by picking the most predictive features from the model.
· Used variable reduction techniques to drop the in-significant variables (multicollinearity).
· Divided the data into training and validation datasets.
· Phase 3: Built Response model at customer’s level (by using Logistic regression).
· Used P value for finding out the fitness of the model.
· Used Boosting and Bagging techniques to further improve the accuracy of the algorithm.
· Finally provided data insights and recommendations for the model. 
· Understanding the client requirement and developing the requirements 
· Application of Predictive Analysis and  descriptive statistics
