PROJECT Details:

1. NetApp Apollo All Flash FAS Storage controller - HA Interconnect
Description:
Apollo is an All Flash FAS storage controller which runs Data ONTAP. The system embeds the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) as the system management intelligence controller.

A interconnect provides a high bandwidth, low latency transport for Data ONTAP subsystems to transfer data between controllers in an HA pair.

 These subsystems are registered as clients to the interconnect software stack. For example, WAFL and RAID use the RDMA write interface to mirror non-volatile memory contents. Fail over Monitor detects status of the partner controller via the RDMA read interface
The HA interconnect uses 100GbE Chelsio T6 iWARP on a PCIe Gen3x16 card. Standard FreeBSD OFED stack will be enabled to run T6 instead of the legacy SK OFED stack on which all the previous interconnect drivers have been developed.

RDMA clients are transport agnostic and have relied on RDMA protocol for low latency, data ordering and placement guarantee and achieve high performance. It's required to present an OFED RDMA like protocol over T6 to ensure RDMA clients are not aware of any underlying transport protocol changes and continue to work without modification.

2. Cisco Catalyst 6500 network switch, Cisco IOS (RTOS) Development

Description:
The Catalyst 6500 is a modular chassis network switch manufactured by Cisco Systems since 1999, capable of delivering speeds of    up to 400 million packets per second.

   A 6500 comprises a chassis, power supplies, one or two supervisors, line cards and service modules. A chassis can have 3, 4, 6, 9 or 13 slots each (Catalyst model 6503, 6504, 6506, 6509, or 6513, respectively) with the option of one or two modular power supplies. The supervisor engine provides centralized forwarding information and processing; up to two of these cards can be installed in a chassis to provide active/standby failover. The line cards provide port connectivity and service modules to allow for devices such as firewalls to be integrated within the switch.
