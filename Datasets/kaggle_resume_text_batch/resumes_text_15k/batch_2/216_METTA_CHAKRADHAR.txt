PROJECT PROFILE:
PROJECT 1: GBMES
Title            : “Hardware Ruggged Data Server/Storage” in BEL (Bharat Electronics Limited).
Team	       :  3 members
Role   	       : Applications Engineer
Description: A Data server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". The Data storage basic functionality is to store the data. The storage capacity of the system depends on no. of Drive Bays with a redundancy raid. The Communication between Drive Bay and Raid Card is done using SAS (Serial Attached Storage) cables each at a transfer speed of 12gbps. Raid (Redundant Array of Independent disk) should be configured and used. 
Participation: 
· Installation and Configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux,10GB ethernet Drivers and checking their Performance and transfer speed from Server to Client
· ATP Scripting (Application Test Procedure) written for Data Server in Linux for accessing all Hardware and Network Ports 
· Configuring duel Redundancy RAID Card for accessing
· Establishing the communication between Server and Client through various communications channels with Ethernet port (iperf) ,Serial port (RS-232/RS-422)
· Worked with IPMI(Intelligent Platform Management Interface ) for hardware health monitoring and management system that defines interfaces for use in monitoring the physical health of servers, such as temperature, voltage, fans, power supplies and chassis
· Preparing Quality Assurance Plan Documents and Acceptance Test Procedure Documents for the Data Server
· Performing various environmental tests (EMI/EMC and etc) in accordance with defense procedure.

Environment:
· RHEL,ATP Script,1GB,10GB Ethernet ports, IPMI, iSCSI, RAID Configuration

PROJECT 2: INS (Inertial Navigation System)
Title            : “Control Display Unit” in RCI DRDO (Research Center Imarat).
Team	       :  2 members
Role   	       :  Applications Engineer
Description: The objective of the Control Display Unit (CDU) is to guide the inertial navigation system (INS) through motion sensors (accelerometers) and rotation sensors (gyroscopes) to continuously calculate the position, orientation and velocity of the moving object without the need of external references. Data (Read & Write) is passed between all the systems through communication systems. It Compromises of two different communications i.e.., RS-232 & RS-422.
Participation:
· Integrating hardware components of CDU’s.
· Installation of Windows XP Embedded Operating System on embedded motherboard by selecting the required components according to the requirement.
· Developing a simulator to communicate between two systems through RS232 and RS422 Protocols in COM applications 
· Performing various environmental tests (EMI/EMC and etc) in accordance with defense procedure.
· Stood for Environmental/EMI/EMC tests which takes place for more hours to days

Environment:
· Windows XP Embedded, Visual Studio C++ V6.0.
