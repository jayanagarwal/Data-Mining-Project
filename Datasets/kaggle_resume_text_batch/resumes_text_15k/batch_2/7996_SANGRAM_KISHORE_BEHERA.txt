PROJECT DETAILS : 
 

B . TECH. Project:    “Anti Collision Device (ACD) for Railway”.  

The Anti-Collision Device (ACD) is a self-acting microprocessor-based data communication device 

designed to prevent high-speed railway collisions in mid-sections, station areas and at level-crossing 

gates. The ACD uses radio frequency signal, global positioning system (GPS) to find the location and 

made the train to halt automatically if the track ahead is not clear.  

 

M.TECH. Project:    “Vision Based Camera Stabilization” Project work carried out at  

NATIONAL AEROSPACE LABORATORIES, BANGALORE  

The autonomous ground vehicles (UGVs) are used for the video surveillance purpose to track the  moving 

target. The tracking of moving objects using a camera mounted on an autonomous ground vehicle is to 

keep the target within the image is addressed. During tracking the target, “CAMERA STABILIZATION” 

is required to keep the target in the FOV (Field Of View) of the camera. The Continuously Adaptive 

Mean Shift (CAMSHIFT) algorithm is used to identify the moving target based on the colour distribution 

of the target histogram. The system is practically implemented and tested using the Arduino platform and 

a cheap low cost web based camera. The Arduino platform is being used to control the camera on a PAN-

TILT servo gimbal structure. Arduino board receives the information about the target, and according to 

that information Arduino board decides the horizontal and vertical movement of the camera to follow that 

target, so that the target remains in FOV of the camera. The angular orientations of the camera are PAN 

(YAW) angle and TILT (PITCH) angle, which are obtained from the angular movement of the servos. 

The PAN angles and TILT angles were validated against the gyroscope sensor values.
