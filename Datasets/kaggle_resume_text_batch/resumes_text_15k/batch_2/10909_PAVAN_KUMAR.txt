Description:

When the IBM Sales, Solutions or Account Mgmts. teams work on a bid (New 
Deals) or intend to strategically offshore work (Lift & Shift work), they identify the scope of services that can potentially be delivered from Delivery Centers in India, China, Argentina, Brazil, Bruno etc. This scope of work, specifically for India, will go through feasibility assessment by India Delivery Center stakeholders by taking various solution aspects into consideration such as baselines to be supported, number of resources estimated, product / technology to be supported, skill levels required, timelines factored for hiring, transition duration, expected go live date, Infrastructure requirements, seating feasibility, support window requirements and so on. This content is packaged in a template called SRR (Delivery Readiness Review). The various groups within India review the SRR and provide their approval/suggestions for changes (if any) on any of the requirements. Post review and approval, these inputs then need to be consolidated and presented in a structured and easily understandable package back to the Deal team who in turn would incorporate these inputs into their Approval package for Proposal submission (for new bids).
