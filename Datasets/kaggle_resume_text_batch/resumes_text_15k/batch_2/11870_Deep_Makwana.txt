floating carriage which works on a shaft and chain mechanism. There are two turbines (fans) on the back 
portion of the model which works on RF remote control. The model lifts the waste by claws and dumps 
it in the container attached behind the model. The container collecting the waste is detachable and can be 
emptied after filling completely. The whole model works on a battery source. The batteries are recharged 
with the help of a solar panel fitted at the top of model.  
                    Thus the model is completely pollution free and eco-friendly. The concept and idea of 
model is designed and made considering the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
